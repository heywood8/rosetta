  // Silent-drop note (FR-PLAN-0015 / FR-PLAN-0016)
  "upsert silently drops status fields — use update_status to change status one-by-one after each task completion",
  // Write-cycle summary (FR-PLAN-0024)
  "write-cycle process (high level): read with retries → modify in memory → rename old file as backup → write new file",
  // Atomic rename + previous_version chain (FR-PLAN-0024)
  "every successful write atomically renames the plan file to <plan_file>.bakNNN before writing the new plan; the plan's previous_version field points to the immediately prior version (the backup captured at write time)",
  // Backup retention (FR-PLAN-0024)
  "backup retention is bounded; the oldest backups beyond the configured limit (default 5) are pruned",
  // Read resilience (FR-SHRD-0009)
  "if the plan file is missing but at least one backup exists, reads retry briefly before returning plan_not_found",
  // Template kind separation (FR-PLAN-0033)
  "templates have two kinds (create, upsert); a template of one kind cannot be used with the other kind",
  // Placeholder syntax (FR-PLAN-0034)
  "placeholder syntax in templates is [placeholder-name]; provided params and declared placeholders must match exactly",
  // Inline JSON-string arguments (FR-PLAN-0044)
  "the JSON-bearing arguments are inline JSON strings: the plan data for create, the patch for upsert, and phase-steps for create-with-template and upsert-with-template are each passed as the JSON value itself directly on the command line (for example '[{\"id\":\"s1\",\"name\":\"Step\",\"prompt\":\"do it\"}]')",
  // End-to-end usage (FR-PLAN-0042)
  "end-to-end usage — build the whole execution plan first, then execute. Build: (1) create the plan and its initial preparation phase with create-with-template, passing the actual phase-steps (the main body of work) to fill that first phase in one call; (2) add each subsequent phase (phase 1, phase 2, …) with upsert-with-template, every call passing the actual phase-steps so the phase arrives complete — the seeded subagent bootstrap steps plus the actual phase-steps; always add every follow-up phase with upsert-with-template (never plain upsert for a new phase); use plain upsert only for follow-up steps and patching existing items (rarely); change status only via update_status; (3) keep steps granular — each step is about 3–5 minutes of an AI coding agent's own work. Execute only after the whole execution plan is built: (4) hand each phase to its subagent, which loops — call next with --target <its phase id> for the next small batch, update_status <step_id> in_progress before starting a step and update_status <step_id> complete once it passes; (5) a phase is finished when next returns count 0 and parent.status is complete; if blocked or failed steps remain, recover them before finishing",
  // Phase-scoped next (FR-PLAN-0042)
  "phase-scoped next: when working a single phase always call next with --target <that phase id> so the batch and all the counts cover only that phase; --target may be passed with or without a limit",
  // What next returns (FR-PLAN-0042)
  "what next returns: next lists steps in priority order — in_progress, then ready open, then blocked, then failed — and cuts the list off at limit (default 3). Because in_progress and open steps come first, when there is enough work to do the blocked and failed steps get cut off and won't appear in that call. The Overall*Count fields are a headcount of every status in scope (open, in_progress, blocked, failed, complete) — a reminder of what exists even when the limit hid some",
  // Three outcomes of a next call (FR-PLAN-0042)
  "three outcomes of a next call: if count is greater than 0, work the returned steps; if count is 0 and the scope is complete (parent.status complete under --target, otherwise plan_status complete), the scope is done; if count is 0 but blocked or failed steps remain, stop looping and recover them",
  // Recover blocked/failed/stuck steps (FR-PLAN-0042)
  "recover blocked, failed, or stuck steps: when OverallBlockedCount or OverallFailedCount is non-zero, or OverallInProgressCount does not fall across calls (a stuck in_progress step), call show_status with --target <phase id> to list every step with its status — it has no limit, so it scales to any number of steps — then for each blocked, failed, or stuck step call query <step_id> for full detail, re-review and re-verify the work, and retry it by resetting its status with update_status <step_id> open (or in_progress) so next surfaces it again; do not finish the phase while any blocked or failed step remains",
