MUST use Rosetta to load current context using `get_context_instructions` tool (if available) and FULLY COMPLETE all prep steps, load files, select and start execution of matching workflow.
If it fails YOU MUST ASK USER (as this is highly critical and unexpected)! If context output was truncated and a file path was provided, you MUST immediately read the full file before proceeding even if large!
