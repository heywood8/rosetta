<description_and_purpose>

Problem: Unstructured coding leads to scope drift, missing validation, autonomous runaway, and misaligned deliverables.
Solution: Sequential workflow with reviewer gates, HITL gates, subagent delegation, and skill-driven execution scaled per Request size classification.
Validation: Each phase produces verifiable outputs; reviewer catches issues before user; HITL gates prevent autonomous runaway; final validation confirms implementation matches approved intent.

<workflow_phases>

<prerequisites phase="0" applies="ALL">

1. All Rosetta prep steps MUST be FULLY completed, SKILL `load-context` loaded and fully executed.
2. MUST USE OPERATION_MANAGER for deterministic execution
3. MUST FOLLOW THIS WORKFLOW ENTIRELY AND FULLY, ALL REQUIRED SCALING IS ALREADY PRE-DEFINED BY "applies" ATTRIBUTE.
4. Phases are sequential. Independent subagent tasks within a phase CAN run in parallel.
5. When debugging is needed, INVOKE SUBAGENT `engineer` and USE SKILL `debugging` to isolate debugging context from implementation.
6. Use INVOKE SUBAGENT `executor` for building, running tests, installing packages, and similar mechanical actions.
7. MUST load each phase's skills when entering that phase (just-in-time) when subagents are not used.

</prerequisites>

<discovery phase="1" applies="MEDIUM,LARGE" subagent="discoverer" role="Context discoverer">

1. Gather project context, affected areas, dependencies, constraints, requirements. SMALL: orchestrator handles inline.
2. Input: user request + `CONTEXT.md` + `ARCHITECTURE.md` + `IMPLEMENTATION.md`. Output: discovery-notes.md in FEATURE PLAN folder.
3. Recommended skills: `load-context`
4. Update `agents/coding-flow-state.md`
5. Do not stop until 100% clear

</discovery>

<design phase="2" applies="ALL" subagent="architect" role="Design architecture requirements and solution">

1. First: design architecture requirements to address user request fully.
2. Second: design 3 best architecture solutions with pro/cons analysis.
3. Third: select the best solution.
4. Input: user request + `CONTEXT.md` + `ARCHITECTURE.md` + `IMPLEMENTATION.md`. Output: concise architecture-notes.md in FEATURE PLAN folder.
5. Recommended skills: `reasoning`, `questioning`
6. Update `agents/coding-flow-state.md`

</design>

<user_review_design phase="3" applies="ALL" type="HITL">

1. Present main solution first and then alternatives, do not assume user is in context, give him full information with TLDR.
1. Present specs, plan, and review findings. User MUST approve: "Yes, I reviewed the design" or "Approve, the design was reviewed".
1. Do NOT assume approval. Anything else = review feedback, iterate.
1. SMALL: combine with Phase 6 into single checkpoint.

</user_review_design>

<tech_plan phase="4" applies="ALL" subagent="architect" role="Senior architect defining specs and plan">

1. MUST USE SKILL `tech-specs` and `planning` together. Split: specs own WHAT, plan owns HOW. Target: 100% clarity.
2. Input: discovery notes, user request, `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Output: `<FEATURE>-SPECS.md` + `<FEATURE>-PLAN.md` in FEATURE PLAN folder.
3. SMALL: output as message, no files. MEDIUM: concise. LARGE: full.
4. Recommended skills: `tech-specs`, `planning`, `reasoning`, `questioning`
5. Update `agents/coding-flow-state.md`

</tech_plan>

<review_plan phase="5" applies="MEDIUM,LARGE" subagent="reviewer" role="Reviewer inspecting specs and plan against intent">

1. Review specs and plan against user request and discovery notes, do not assume user is in context, give him full information with TLDR.
2. Input: specs, plan, user request. Output: review findings and recommendations.
3. Recommended skills: `reasoning`
4. Update `agents/coding-flow-state.md`

</review_plan>

<user_review_plan phase="6" applies="ALL" type="HITL">

1. Present specs, plan, and review findings. User MUST approve: "Yes, I reviewed the plan" or "Approve, the plan and specs were reviewed".
2. Do NOT assume approval. Anything else = review feedback, iterate.

</user_review_plan>

<implementation phase="7" applies="ALL" subagent="engineer" role="Senior engineer executing approved plan">

1. Implement approved plan. Build MUST succeed. Tests excluded.
2. Input: approved specs + plan. Output: working code, build passing, update relevant documentation briefly (CONTEXT.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc).
3. MUST follow approved scope. MUST stop and escalate if blocked.
4. Recommended skills: `coding`, `debugging`, `coding-iac`, `sensitive-data`, `testing`, `dangerous-actions`
5. If requirements are used code must contain comments refs to requirement identifiers
6. Update `agents/coding-flow-state.md`

</implementation>

<review_code phase="8" applies="ALL" subagent="reviewer" role="Reviewer inspecting implementation against specs">

1. Review code changes against approved specs and plan.
2. Input: implementation diff, specs, plan, check if documentation is updated, brief, and matches the file intent. Output: review findings and recommendations.
3. Recommended skills: `reasoning`, `coding`, `debugging`, `coding-iac`, `sensitive-data`, `testing`, `dangerous-actions`
4. Update `agents/coding-flow-state.md`
