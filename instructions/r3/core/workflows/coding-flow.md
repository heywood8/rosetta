<description_and_purpose>

Problem: Unstructured coding leads to scope drift, missing validation, autonomous runaway, and misaligned deliverables.
Solution: Sequential workflow with reviewer gates, HITL gates, subagent delegation, and skill-driven execution scaled per Request size classification.
Validation: Each phase produces verifiable outputs; reviewer catches issues before user; HITL gates prevent autonomous runaway; final validation confirms implementation matches approved intent.

<workflow_phases>

<prerequisites phase="0" applies="ALL">

1. All Rosetta prep steps MUST be FULLY completed, SKILL `load-context` loaded and fully executed.
2. MUST USE OPERATION_MANAGER for deterministic execution
3. MUST FOLLOW THIS WORKFLOW ENTIRELY AND FULLY, ALL REQUIRED SCALING IS ALREADY PRE-DEFINED BY "applies" ATTRIBUTE.
4. Phases are sequential. Independent subagent tasks within a phase CAN run in parallel.
5. When debugging is needed, INVOKE SUBAGENT `engineer` and USE SKILL `debugging` to isolate debugging context from implementation.
6. Use INVOKE SUBAGENT `executor` for building, running tests, installing packages, and similar mechanical actions.
7. MUST load each phase's skills when entering that phase (just-in-time) when subagents are not used.
8. If workflow is executed to implement requirements and those exists in REQUIREMENTS folder, MUST USE SKILL `requirements-use` and load all affected requirements (after skill is loaded). After that subagents must be given pointers to those requirements and skill.
9. If `/goal` is set repeat phases 7-12 postponing user_review_impl and final_validation until goal is met.
10. Coding workflow state is saved to AGENTS TEMP FEATURE folder as `coding-flow-state.md` file.
11. If migrate/modernize: implementation phase MUST use tiny batches ONLY (1-3 files), never bulk-read (other phases may); specs/plan enforce; FS-copy RECOMMENDED; no behavior change/new code; mirror source; subagents same; REQUIRED TO log <file> started/completed.

</prerequisites>
