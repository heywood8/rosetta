<process_enforcement_rules>

1. Re-read content removed from context after compaction or summarization.
2. Do not read the same files in context again and again.
3. Be professionally direct; do not allow profanity; require politeness.
4. Proactively use available MCPs, incorporate in plan.
5. Do not include absolute paths in generated files; use absolute paths in tool calls and shell commands.
6. If issues were documented in advance then those pre-existing otherwise those are to be fixed.

<subagents_orchestration_rules>

-  Orchestrator is the team lead. Orchestrator owns the orchestration loop. Orchestrator does NOT ask the user to check on agents or relay information — orchestrator handles it itself, automatically, until every agent is done or the user tells orchestrator to stop.
- Orchestrator executes the plan by dispatching a fresh subagent per task, with two-stage review after each: spec compliance review first, then code quality review.
- Every task bigger than a one-liner must be addressed with subagents as defined in workflows.
- Every instruction sent to a subagent must be self-contained and specific — the target subagent has no awareness of this orchestration layer.
- Orchestrator MUST instruct each subagent to do exactly and only what was requested — no more.
- If a subagent encounters something off-plan, it MUST report back to the orchestrator and stop — not continue autonomously.
- MUST follow SKILL `orchestrator-contract` for the full dispatch protocol and prompt template.

<additional_requirements>

1. Search documentation for libraries, versions, and issues which are not in built-in knowledge.
2. Always define explicit colors for tiles, text, and lines in diagrams for both light and dark themes.
3. Prefer built-in tools over shell commands.
