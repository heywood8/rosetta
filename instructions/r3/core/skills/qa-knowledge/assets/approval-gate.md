# QA approval gate

Shared QA explicit-approval gate: closed-token discipline, loose-phrasing rejection, max-retry escalation, partial approval.

<approval-gate>

Present-and-wait gate before an irreversible/high-stakes step (apply corrections, approve a spec/plan). Phase supplies: **closed approval-token list**, **re-present step**, **revisit target** (full reject). Specializes `hitl`; the phase's closed token list is authoritative.

1. Present the artifact; **WAIT** for explicit approval (no-assume-approval → `hitl`).
2. **Approval = an exact token from the phase's closed list** (case-insensitive). Anything outside it is REVIEW, not approval -- re-prompt (the base "a message / question / suggestion is not approval" rule is owned by `hitl`). `"or similar"`/`"etc."` never extends the list.
3. **Max-retry escalation:** after ≥3 re-prompts without an exact token, stop and ask: "approve (type an exact token), or request changes / reject?" -- never silently re-prompt beyond 3.
4. **Partial approval** (user names specific items/hunks) applies ONLY the named items.
5. **Change request** (modify/add/drop): batch all changes, update, re-present from the phase's re-present step. **≥3 cycles on overlapping scope:** stop, ask whether to re-open the upstream phase or escalate scope.
6. **Full reject** (no in-place fix): record the rationale in the state file, return to the phase's revisit target.
