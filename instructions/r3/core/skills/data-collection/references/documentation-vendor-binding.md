# Vendor binding: Documentation vendor

**Canonical vendor example: Confluence** -- capabilities (page fetch / search / child pages) and harvesting discipline below use Confluence; for another backend (Notion, SharePoint, wiki) map by capability, same method. Base SKILL.md owns the general method -- not restated here. All specs/queries/MCP/URL here use Confluence as example, adapt target wiki system by example.

**Operations below are named by capability, not by a fixed tool name.** Resolve each to the actual tool exposed by the configured documentation MCP binding: **get page**, **list child pages**, **search** (structured query or free text), and -- write, forbidden in this read-only binding -- **create / update page / add comment**.

---

## Input parsing

The phase supplies one input form; validate shape BEFORE any MCP call (malformed input → failure path "input-unresolvable"; host mismatch → "cross-domain URL"). Never retrieve against malformed input (it produces silent zero-result branches that look like "no pages found").

| Input form | Example shape (Confluence) | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| Page ID | numeric (Cloud) or alphanumeric (some Server) | non-empty + matches host ID format |
| Page URL (any form) | display `…/wiki/spaces/<SPACE>/pages/<ID>/<slug>`, direct `…?pageId=<ID>`, or short `…/x/<short-id>` | extract the page ID (path segment, `pageId` param, or resolve the short link via MCP); host MUST match the configured MCP site |
| Search terms | keywords / labels / components / project key | ≥1 keyword OR ≥1 label/component/project key |

The example-shape column illustrates the canonical vendor; a different backend uses its own URL forms -- match by capability (a page reference vs. search terms), not by these literal shapes.

Store each page under a **stable canonical reference** the backend guarantees (for Confluence, `/spaces/<KEY>/pages/<numeric-id>`). When the supplied form differs (display/short), store that canonical reference AND record the original pasted form in the page entry so reviewers can trace what was pasted.

## Retrieval & harvesting discipline (`extract + normalize` step)

**Direct-URL path (preferred when URLs/IDs supplied):**
1. **Get page** for each supplied page -- convert the body to markdown and include metadata.
2. **List child pages** -- fetch up to 5 relevant child pages per parent, recursing to leaves or the phase's depth cap. Ask once for child links (or approval to continue parent-only) and record the decision (`Children fetched: yes | no (reason)`) when the API does not expose child relationships and children are still plausible.

**Search path (when no URLs supplied):**
1. Build a **scoped search query** -- combine a space/scope filter AND a label/term predicate. **Always scope to the project space when its key is known** (dominant noise reducer; unscoped search breaks deterministic ranking). Express it in the backend's query language; for Confluence that is CQL:
   - Worked (CQL): `space = PROJ AND (label = "feature-x" OR text ~ "checkout refund")`
   - Fallback (labels unknown): `space = PROJ AND text ~ "<key-term>"`
2. **Search** with that query (cap ~10 results). Zero results → jump to the fallback GATE (ask the user first); only after the user supplies nothing does the "zero-pages" failure stop apply.
3. **Deterministic ranking** -- fixed priority `title-match > label-match > body-match`; in-tier tiebreaker = MCP relevance score / recency. Record the query + top-N page IDs + ranking in the artifact's `Search Provenance` section for reproducibility.
4. Retrieve top 3–5 pages via **get page** (same error branches as the direct path), then their child pages.

**Cross-vendor:** when this binding runs beside Jira/TestRail, derive search terms from the upstream ticket (labels, components, summary keywords) the phase passes in; the phase owns merging the documentation section with the ticket section.

**Normalization discipline:**
- **Truncate** pages over the phase's word budget (default ~5000 words); insert a banner naming the budget, the section where truncation happened, and the omitted section headings, e.g. `<!-- truncated: 5000-word budget reached at section 'Deployment Steps'; remaining 3 sections omitted: 'Monitoring', 'Rollback', 'Appendix' -->`. Keep headings + first sections intact.
- **Deduplicate** by canonical URL; merge parents before children unless the phase overrides.

## Per-page branch (normalize into the phase's section)

- **Present + content non-empty** → include (Page header: URL / Space / Labels / Updated / Type / Status; `#### Content`; `#### Child Pages`); redact body first.
- **Permission-restricted** (body 401/403 OR MCP indicates restriction) → `<restricted by permissions> -- body not retrievable with configured Confluence MCP credentials` + a gap entry. A 401/403 is NOT empty content; never silently treat as missing.
- **Content empty** (retrieved but body empty) → `[empty page]` marker + gap. Do NOT fabricate.

**Rendered example** (one normalized page entry in the phase's output artifact):

```markdown
#### Checkout Refund Flow  (/spaces/PROJ/pages/12345)
- **Space / Labels / Updated / Type / Status:** PROJ / `refund`, `checkout` / 2026-04-18 / page / current
#### Content
Refunds are issued via POST /api/v1/orders/{id}/refund; a paid order transitions PAID → REFUNDED…
#### Child Pages
- Refund Edge Cases (/spaces/PROJ/pages/12346)
```

## Redaction targets

Highest-risk: **page bodies** (runbooks/ops notes embed secrets; incident write-ups embed PII). Redact per SKILL `<collection>` step 4. Verbatim structure (adds to step 4's generic list): headings, business-rule prose, in-site link targets, glossary entries.

## Failure paths (SKILL `extract` step)

- **Input unresolvable** (no URL/ID/terms, or URL unparseable) → stop, report `data-collection/confluence: input unresolvable -- supply page URL/ID or search terms`, ask. Do NOT guess.
- **MCP/CLI/Fetch not configured / not authenticated** → stop, report `data-collection/confluence: Confluence MCP not configured or not authenticated -- verify MCP setup`. Do NOT emit a zero-page artifact and call it done.
- **MCP/CLI/Fetch transport error** → per SKILL `<collection>` step 3 (retry once, then stop + report); ask to verify MCP connectivity.
- **Page not found** (404 / deleted, for a supplied page ID or URL) → stop, report `data-collection/confluence: page <id/url> not found -- verify the ID/URL is correct and accessible`, ask. Do NOT treat as an empty page or silently gap it. (Applies to direct URL/ID retrieval; missing search hits use the zero-pages GATE below.)
- **Authorization failure** (401/403 on ALL pages) → stop, report `data-collection/confluence: request rejected -- page(s) may exist but not visible to configured credentials`, ask to verify credentials / space access. (Per-page 401/403 with others succeeding → per-page branch above, not a global stop.)
- **Cross-domain URL** (host ≠ configured MCP site) → warn + try once; on failure stop the fetch, report `URL <url> belongs to a different Confluence host (<domain>) than the configured MCP -- ask user for an in-site equivalent or accept ticket-only continuation`. Do NOT bypass to a cross-site fetch.
- **Zero pages after URL + search + user-fallback exhausted** → the fallback GATE asks the user FIRST; only if the user supplies neither URLs nor approval-to-skip does this stop fire. On user "skip / proceed without docs" → record `Documentation: not available -- user approved no-docs continuation` + a gap, proceed with an empty Documentation block. Do NOT fabricate.

## Output sections (within the phase-owned artifact)

The phase owns the artifact path + heading; this binding emits, in order: per-page entries (per the per-page branch above); `Search Provenance` (search query + top-N IDs + ranking, or `N/A -- URL-driven retrieval`); `Gaps` (empty/restricted/cross-domain pages, or `None.`); redaction section (or `None.`). Every section present; empties use `None.`.

## Validation items (binding-specific, added to SKILL `<validation_checklist>`)

- Every stored page lists title, canonical URL, and parent/child relationship when applicable.
- Child pages checked for each parent OR waived via the ask-once GATE with the decision recorded.
- Truncated pages carry the omission banner.
- Zero-result / no-docs path ends in an explicit recorded user decision, not a silent empty.
- Permission-restricted pages recorded as `<restricted by permissions>`.
- Search Provenance populated whenever the search path ran.
- Read-only: none of the forbidden write operations (see Operations) was called.
