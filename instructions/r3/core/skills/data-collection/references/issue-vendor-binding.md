# Vendor binding: Issue vendor

**Canonical issue vendor example: Jira** -- the field map and examples below use Jira; for another tracker (Linear, GitHub Issues, Azure Boards) map by capability, same method. Base SKILL.md owns the general method (extract → normalize → redact → write) -- not restated here. All specs/queries/MCP/URL here use Jira as example, adapt target issue tracker system by example.

**Operations below are named by capability, not by a fixed tool name.** Resolve each to the actual tool exposed by the configured issue-tracker MCP/CLI/Fetch binding: **get issue** (with fields / expand / comment-limit), **search fields** (field-schema lookup), and -- write, forbidden in this read-only binding -- issue **create / update / transition / add comment**.

---

## Input parsing

The phase supplies a ticket key or URL. Resolve the canonical key:

- **Plain key** `PROJ-123` → use directly.
- **URL** `https://jira.company.com/browse/PROJ-123` or `https://*.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123` → parse the `PROJ-NNN` segment.
- **Ambiguous / missing / malformed** → stop per failure path "input-unresolvable". Do NOT guess or pick an arbitrary key.

## Retrieval (`extract + normalize` step)

**Get issue** by its canonical key. Fetch the whole issue -- do NOT restrict the response to a fixed field list; the field map below is the minimal set to normalize, not a retrieval filter. Request rendered fields (so HTML descriptions convert to markdown).

- **Custom fields:** use **search fields** to resolve names when the issue returns cryptic IDs (`customfield_10012`). Discovery failure → list the cryptic IDs + a gap note `Custom field schema unavailable -- field names may be cryptic`. Do not stop.
- **Comment cap:** at most 10 comments; if more exist, record a gap `Comments: showing 10 most recent; <total> total exist`.

## Field map (normalize into the phase's section)

| Field | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ticket key + URL | input | canonical key + browse URL |
| Summary | `summary` | required; empty → gap |
| Type / Status / Priority | `issuetype` / `status` / `priority` | |
| Created / Updated | `created` / `updated` | |
| Description | `description` (rendered) | required; redact before write; empty → gap |
| Labels / Components | `labels` / `components` | `None` if absent |
| Assignee / Reporter | `assignee` / `reporter` | `<restricted by permissions>` if hidden; `None -- unassigned` if empty |
| Comments (≤10) | `comment` | per-comment author + date + body; redact bodies |
| Custom fields | `customfield_*` | resolve names via **search fields**; `None -- no custom fields populated` if empty |

Per-field branch per SKILL `<collection>` step 3; Jira restricted-gap message: `<field>: not visible to configured Jira credentials`. Continue extraction.

**Rendered example** (a normalized Jira issue block in the phase's output artifact):

```markdown
### PROJ-123 — Login returns 500 on empty username
- **Type / Status / Priority:** Bug / In Progress / High
- **Summary:** Login page throws 500 on empty username
- **Description:** submitting the login form with a blank username returns HTTP 500 instead of a 400 validation error
- **Labels / Components:** `auth`, `login` / `api-gateway`
- **Comments (≤10):** 2 shown — @dev (2026-05-01): "repro confirmed on staging"
```

## Redaction targets

Highest-risk: the **description** and each **comment body** (embed credentials/PII in stack traces and customer reports). Redact per SKILL `<collection>` step 4; structure (feature names, endpoint paths, methods, status codes, field/schema names) stays verbatim.

## Failure paths (SKILL `extract` step)

- **Input unresolvable** (no/malformed key, URL not a recognizable Jira pattern) → stop, report `data-collection/jira: ticket key unresolvable from input "<input>"`, ask the phase/user for a canonical `PROJ-NNN` or URL. Do NOT guess.
- **MCP/CLI/Fetch transport error** → per SKILL `<collection>` step 3 (retry once, then stop + report); ask to verify the Jira MCP/CLI/Fetch configuration.
- **Ticket-not-found** (404 / empty / "issue does not exist") → stop, report `data-collection/jira: ticket <KEY> not found -- verify the key`. Do NOT emit a partial artifact.
- **Authorization failure** (401/403) → stop, report `data-collection/jira: request rejected -- ticket <KEY> may exist but is not visible to the configured credentials`, ask to verify credentials / project access.
- **Required field empty / permission-restricted / search-fields discovery failure** → per the field-map per-field branch above (continue + gap, do not stop).

## Validation items (binding-specific, added to SKILL `<validation_checklist>`)

- **Get issue** returned a non-empty issue object, else a failure path was followed instead.
- Summary + Description present or in gaps; every empty/restricted required field in gaps.
- Comment cap ≤10 honored with the overflow gap note when more exist.
- Custom-field discovery attempted on cryptic `customfield_NNNNN` IDs.
- Read-only: none of the forbidden write operations (see Operations) was called.
