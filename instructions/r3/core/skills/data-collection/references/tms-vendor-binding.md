# Vendor binding: TMS / test-case vendor

**Canonical test-case vendor example: TestRail** -- the field map and examples below use TestRail; for another test-case manager map by capability, same method. Base SKILL.md owns the general method -- not restated here.  All specs/queries/MCP/URL here use TestRail as example, adapt target test-case management system by example.

**Operations below are named by capability, not by a fixed tool name.** Resolve each to the actual tool exposed by the configured TMS MCP/CLI/Fetch binding: **get case**, **get case fields** (case-field-schema lookup), and -- write, forbidden in this read-only binding -- case **update / add / delete**.

---

## Input parsing

The phase supplies a test case ID or URL. Resolve the numeric case ID:

- **Numeric ID** `12345` or `C12345` (strip the `C` prefix) → use directly.
- **URL** `https://*.testrail.io/index.php?/cases/view/N` or similar → parse the trailing numeric ID.
- **Ambiguous / missing / malformed** → stop per failure path "input-unresolvable". Do NOT guess or pick an arbitrary ID.

## Retrieval (`extract + normalize` step)

**Get case** by its resolved numeric ID.

- **Custom fields:** if field names are unclear/cryptic, use **get case fields**. Discovery failure → record under Custom Fields `Custom field schema unavailable -- field names may be cryptic`. Do not stop.

## Field map (normalize into the phase's section)

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Case ID + Title | Title required; empty → gap |
| Section path | section the case lives under |
| Priority / Type | |
| Test Goal | what is being tested and why |
| Preconditions | list; `None` if absent |
| Test Steps | step-by-step actions, each with an expected result; a step missing its expected result is a gap (`gap: expected result missing`), not an acceptable record |
| Expected Overall Result | required; empty → gap |
| Custom fields | API endpoint, HTTP method, etc. when present; resolve via **get case fields** |

Per-field branch per SKILL `<collection>` step 3 (redact sensitive values first); TestRail empty/missing gap note: `missing in TestRail source` -- never blank, assume, or fabricate.

**Rendered example** (one normalized case in the phase's output artifact -- one step with a proper expected result, one with the gap marker):

```markdown
### C12345 — Refund a paid order
- **Section:** Billing / Refunds · **Priority:** High · **Type:** Functional
- **Test Goal:** verify a paid order can be fully refunded
- **Preconditions:** order `o-12345` exists with status `PAID`
- **Steps:**
  1. POST /api/v1/orders/o-12345/refund → Expected: status 200, `body.status == "REFUNDED"`
  2. GET /api/v1/orders/o-12345 → Expected: `gap: expected result missing`
- **Expected Overall Result:** order shows `REFUNDED`; refund recorded
```

## Redaction targets

Highest-risk: **step text, preconditions, custom fields, test-data** -- these re-emit downstream (the phase's output artifact → requirements / test-scenarios / authoring) and can be exported back into the shared TestRail project. Redact per SKILL `<collection>` step 4; structure (action verbs, expected behaviors, endpoint paths, methods, status codes, field/schema names) stays verbatim.

## Failure paths (SKILL `extract` step)

- **Input unresolvable** (no/malformed ID, URL not a recognizable TestRail pattern) → stop, report `data-collection/testrail: case ID unresolvable from input "<input>"`, ask for a clean numeric ID or canonical URL. Do NOT guess.
- **MCP/CLI/Fetch transport error** → per SKILL `<collection>` step 3 (retry once, then stop + report; same case ID); ask to verify the TestRail MCP/CLI/Fetch configuration.
- **Case-not-found** (404 / empty / "case does not exist") → stop, report `data-collection/testrail: case <ID> not found -- verify the ID is correct and accessible by the configured credentials`. Do NOT emit a partial/empty artifact, do NOT fabricate fields.
- **Authorization failure** (401/403) → stop, report `data-collection/testrail: request rejected -- case <ID> may exist but is not visible to the configured credentials`, ask to verify credentials / project access.
- **Required field empty** (title/steps/expected results missing) **or get-case-fields discovery fails** → proceed via the field-map per-field branch above (continue + gap/note, do NOT fabricate or stop); the artifact still emits but flags the gap.

## Validation items (binding-specific, added to SKILL `<validation_checklist>`)

- **Get case** returned a non-empty case object, else a failure path was followed instead.
- Title, Test Steps, Expected Overall Result present or in gaps; no required field silently blank.
- Each test step has an expected result OR a `gap: expected result missing` marker.
- Read-only: none of the forbidden write operations (see Operations) was called.
