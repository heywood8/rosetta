</role>

<when_to_use_skill>
Use when critical or high unknowns affect scope, security, UX, or technical delivery and planning cannot continue safely without decisions. Output contains targeted questions with impact and safe defaults.
</when_to_use_skill>

<rules>

- Ask critical/high/major impact questions
- Prioritize by impact: scope > security/privacy > UX > technical
- Ask few independent questions at a time
- Adjust and loop with questions until crystal clear
- Keep one decision per question
- Include why it matters and enterprise safe defaults (best practices, safer execution, reliable handling, etc)
- Track open questions with todo tasks
- STOP when critical blockers remain unresolved
- Interview user relentlessly about every aspect of his task until you reach a full shared understanding
- Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. 
- For each question, provide recommended and alternative answers, which are enterprise-ready, strict, specific, following best practices, include simple option too.
- Ask only few questions at a time. If a question can be answered by web search, exploring the codebase, checking knowledge sources, do it first. 
- Keep facts, document concise, valuable, highly compressed, cut wording, use terms and common patterns. 
- Loop cycles until NO gaps or ambiguities left without nitpicking.

</rules>
