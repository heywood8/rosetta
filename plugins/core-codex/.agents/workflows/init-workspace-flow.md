<init_workspace_flow>

<description_and_purpose>

Problem: Workspace initialization is multi-phase, order-dependent, and must handle install/upgrade/plugin modes without overwriting human content.
Validation: State file tracks every phase with file inventory; verification confirms all files exist.

</description_and_purpose>

<workflow_phases>

- All Rosetta prep steps MUST be FULLY completed (get_context_instructions called and all three prep steps completed).
- MUST FOLLOW THIS WORKFLOW EXACTLY AND FULLY.
- MUST extensively use subagents as this is a large workflow.
- Sequential phases. Each updates `agents/init-workspace-flow-state.md`. Optional phases marked as skipped. Keep state file very brief.
- ACCURACY > SPEED
- Dual-mode: every phase reads `state.mode` → check-exists → identify-gaps → create/update → preserve-human-content → report-changes.
- Composite workspace: documentation phases create top-level registry referencing sub-repository docs.
- IF state.file_count >= 50 (set by Phase 3): pass "ACQUIRE `large-workspace-handling/SKILL.md` FROM KB" to Phase 5, 6, 8 subagents.
- Before Phase 1: create `agents/init-workspace-flow-state.md`.
- Conditional phases:
  - If you have already in context "RUNNING AS A PLUGIN": MUST NOT EXECUTE "shells" phase 2
  - Else MUST EXECUTE "shells" phase 2
- Note: `rosetta@rosetta` is an MCP connector, not a plugin — it follows the normal path (shells phase 2 executes)
- If user says to initialize rules, subagents, agents, workflows, commands it ONLY means to execute "shells" phase 2.
- Upgrade from R1 to R2 is exactly the same process as define here, but you already have some files available, which you can reuse.
- Additionally tell subagents: "If you want to use shell commands, prefer to combine individual shell commands into single **simple** shell script in `agents/TEMP` and execute it, but already available tools ALWAYS take precedence."

<context phase="1" subagent="built-in" role="Workspace mode detector" subagent_recommended_model="claude-haiku-4-5, gemini-3-flash-preview">

1. Detect mode: install, upgrade, or plugin. Set state.mode, state.plugin_active, state.composite, state.existing_files.
2. ACQUIRE `init-workspace-flow-context.md` FROM KB
3. Update state

</context>

<shells phase="2" default="true" subagent="built-in" conditional role="Shell file generator" subagent_recommended_model="claude-sonnet-4-6, gpt-5.4-medium">

1. Generate shell files for skills, agents, workflows. Skip if state.plugin_active.
2. Output: shell configs, bootstrap rule, load-context skill shell.
3. ACQUIRE `init-workspace-flow-shells.md` FROM KB
4. Update state

</shells>

<discovery phase="3" subagent="built-in" role="Tech stack analyst" subagent_recommended_model="claude-haiku-4-5, gemini-3-flash-preview">

1. Analyze workspace tech stack, structure, file count.
2. Output: TECHSTACK.md, CODEMAP.md, DEPENDENCIES.md, state.file_count.
3. ACQUIRE `init-workspace-flow-discovery.md` FROM KB
4. Update state

</discovery>

<rules phase="4" optional="true" permanently-disabled subagent="built-in" role="Agent rules configurator" subagent_recommended_model="claude-sonnet-4-6, gpt-5.4-medium">
DISABLED
</rules>

<patterns phase="5" subagent="built-in" role="Pattern extractor" subagent_recommended_model="claude-sonnet-4-6, gpt-5.4-medium, gemini-3.1-pro-preview">

1. Extract coding and architectural patterns into reusable templates.
2. Output: PATTERNS folder (one .md per pattern, INDEX.md, CHANGES.md).
3. ACQUIRE `init-workspace-flow-patterns.md` FROM KB
4. Update state. Log gaps for Phase 7.

</patterns>

<documentation phase="6" subagent="built-in" role="Documentation analyst" subagent_recommended_model="claude-opus-4-6, gpt-5.4-high, gemini-3.1-pro-preview">

1. Create project documentation from workspace analysis.
2. Output: CONTEXT.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ASSUMPTIONS.md, AGENT MEMORY.md.
3. ACQUIRE `init-workspace-flow-documentation.md` FROM KB
4. Update state. Log gaps for Phase 7.

</documentation>

<questions phase="7" type="HITL" role="Reflective gap-filler">

1. Review all docs, identify gaps, ask user reflective questions, update affected files via subagents.
2. ACQUIRE `init-workspace-flow-questions.md` FROM KB
3. Update state

</questions>

<verification phase="8" subagent="built-in" role="Completeness validator" subagent_recommended_model="claude-sonnet-4-6, gpt-5.4-medium">

1. Verify all files exist, run validation checklist, suggest next steps.
2. ACQUIRE `init-workspace-flow-verification.md` FROM KB
3. Mark state as COMPLETE.
4. Notify user: delete `init-rosetta-shells-flow.md`. MUST start new chat session (highly visible message, red icon, bold, ASCII art, it must standout).

<pitfalls>

- Phase 4 (rules) is optional — disabled by default.
- Phase 7 must update files via subagents, not just collect answers.
- Shells and rules take effect only after new chat session.
