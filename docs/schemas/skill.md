# Licensing & Compatibility (Optional, remove if not needed)
license: [License name or reference to bundled license file] [string] [Cursor, OpenCode] [ex: MIT]
compatibility: [Environment requirements (system packages, network access, etc.)] [string] [Cursor, OpenCode] [ex: 'Requires docker and kubectl']

# Invocation & Discovery (Optional, remove if not needed)
disable-model-invocation: [When true, the skill is only included when explicitly invoked via /skill-name. The agent will not automatically apply it based on context] [boolean] [Cursor, Claude Code] 
user-invocable: [Set to false to hide from the / menu. Use for background knowledge users shouldn't invoke directly. Default: true] [boolean] [Claude Code] [ex: false]
argument-hint: [Hint shown during autocomplete to indicate expected arguments] [string] [Claude Code] [ex: issue-number, filename]

# Tools & Model Configuration (Optional)
allowed-tools: [Tools Claude can use without asking permission when this skill is active, dangerous, only keep it when you know exactly] [string] [Claude Code] [ex: Bash(git diff:*)]
model: [Model to use when this skill is active] [string] [Claude Code] [ex: claude-3.5-sonnet]

[Latest Models: Anthropic (claude-opus-4-6, claude-sonnet-4-6, claude-haiku-4-5), OpenAI (gpt-5.3-codex-medium, gpt-5.3-codex-high, gpt-5.4-medium, gpt-5.4-high), Google (gemini-3.1-pro-preview, gemini-3-flash-preview), Z.ai (glm-5).]

[Model families: large (smart and slow) {opus, high, pro}, medium (workhorse) {sonnet, medium, glm-5, kimi-k2.5, minimax-m2.5}, small (fast, not smart) {haiku, glm-4.7, flash, mini, low} ]

# Execution Context (Optional, remove if not needed)
context: [Set to 'fork' to run in a forked subagent context] [string] [Claude Code]
agent: [Which subagent type to use when context is set to 'fork'] [string] [Claude Code] [ex: code-reviewer]

# Other (Optional, remove if not needed)
hooks: [Hooks scoped to this skill's lifecycle. See Hooks in skills and agents for configuration format] [object] [Claude Code]

tags: ["one", "second"]

# do not remove baseSchema!
baseSchema: docs/schemas/skill.md

[ONLY FOR TEMPLATE EXECUTOR: imperative bullet points, shorter lines, distinguish references to repository files vs instructions; skill/subagent names will be in context already, so just reference it. the rest of instruction folder files: rules/templates/workflows/assets/subfolders of skill/etc must be ACQUIRE'd / SEARCH'd / LIST'd to be used]

<[the_skill_name]>

<role>

[Optional, Define role with specialization of the agent executing this skill, use expressive language, seniority, brilliant and short]

</role>

<when_to_use_skill>

[KEEP THIS VERY SHORT. Define a problem and retrospectively introspectively validation proof that this prompt actually solves the problem, explain the scenarios, conditions, or situations where this skill should be used]

</when_to_use_skill>

<core_concepts>

- All Rosetta prep steps MUST be FULLY completed, load-context skill loaded and fully executed

[Optional, KEEP THIS VERY SHORT, Describe the fundamental concepts, principles, definitions and explanations required to properly execute the skill]

</core_concepts>

<process>

[Optional, KEEP THIS VERY SHORT, Every line is an ACTION (imperative verb) or a GATE (condition), No explaining what the agent already knows how to do, Define contracts/structures ONCE, DRY, No vague qualifiers, No patronizing, No tautology, No filler words]

</process>


<validation_checklist>

[Optional, KEEP THIS VERY SHORT, do NOT repeat the rest of the prompt, it must not just restate the same: prompt tells what to do, instead it should be proof-oriented — observable evidence that the output is correct, proof that work was done correctly]

- Checkpoint 1
- Checkpoint 2
...

</validation_checklist>

<best_practices>

[Optional, KEEP THIS VERY SHORT, do NOT repeat, List recommended practices, tips, and guidelines for effectively using this skill]

- Practice 1
- Practice 2
...

<pitfalls>

[Optional section, KEEP THIS VERY SHORT, do NOT repeat, provide unexpected mistakes, edge cases, caveats, unusual, errors, gotchas, traps, non-obvious patterns or issues to take into account or avoid]

</pitfalls>

<resources>

[Optional, List helpful resources, references, or related materials, do not duplicate]

- [Type of object referenced] [Reference] [Description, optional]
