[MAIN INTENTION: workflow phases defined here should be reusable and adaptable, the file must be small and short, skills already define how things work! Be concise! Save tokens!]

[ONLY FOR TEMPLATE EXECUTOR: imperative bullet points, shorter lines, distinguish references to repository files vs instructions; skill/subagent names will be in context already, so just reference it. the rest of instruction folder files: rules/templates/workflows/assets/subfolders of skill/etc must be ACQUIRE'd / SEARCH'd / LIST'd to be used]

[Latest Models: Anthropic (claude-opus-4-8, claude-sonnet-5, claude-haiku-4-5), OpenAI (gpt-5.3-codex-medium, gpt-5.3-codex-high, gpt-5.4-medium, gpt-5.4-high, gpt-5.5-high), Google (gemini-3.1-pro-preview, gemini-3-flash-preview), Z.ai (glm-5).]

[Model families: large (smart and slow) {opus, high, pro}, medium (workhorse) {sonnet, medium, glm-5, kimi-k2.5, minimax-m2.5}, small (fast, not smart) {haiku, glm-4.7, flash, mini, low} ]

<validation_checklist>

[Optional, KEEP THIS VERY SHORT, do NOT repeat the rest of the prompt, it must not just restate the same: prompt tells what to do, instead it should be proof-oriented — observable evidence that the output is correct, proof that work was done correctly]

- Checkpoint 2
