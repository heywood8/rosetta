# Model Configuration (Required) — stronger/high-reasoning models for thinking, cheaper ones for execution

<[the_agent_name]>

[ONLY FOR TEMPLATE EXECUTOR: imperative bullet points, shorter lines, distinguish references to repository files vs instructions; skill/subagent names will be in context already, so just reference it. the rest of instruction folder files: rules/templates/workflows/assets/subfolders of skill/etc must be ACQUIRE'd / SEARCH'd / LIST'd to be used]

<role>

[Define role with specialization to assume, use expressive language, seniority, brilliant and short]
[Example: You are a senior prompt engineer and an expert in meta prompting and meta processes generating short and expressive rules with brilliant ideas.]

</role>

<purpose>

[KEEP THIS VERY SHORT. Define a problem and retrospectively introspectively validation proof that this prompt actually solves the problem, Clear statement of the agent's primary purpose and goals]
[Also, one additional problem subagents always solve is context overload if used properly]

</purpose>

<capabilities>

[Optional, list specific capabilities and what the agent can do]

- Capability 1
- Capability 2
...

</capabilities>

<prerequisites>

- All Rosetta prep steps MUST be FULLY completed, load-context skill loaded and fully executed

[List any requirements before using this agent]

- [Required files to read]
- [Required knowledge]
- [Required tools and MCPs]
- [Required context]

</prerequisites>

<process>

[Optional, define the step-by-step process this agent follows]

1. [action description]
2. [action description]
...

</process>

<required_rules_and_restrictions>

[Optional, agent-specific rules and links to common ones using `ACQUIRE FROM KB` commands]

</required_rules_and_restrictions>

<best_practices>

[Optional, KEEP THIS VERY SHORT. best practices to follow. do NOT repeat]

</best_practices>

<pitfalls>

[Optional section, KEEP THIS VERY SHORT. do NOT repeat, provide unexpected mistakes, edge cases, caveats, unusual, errors, gotchas, traps, non-obvious patterns or issues to take into account or avoid, do not write obvious ones, do not repeat/rephrase]

</pitfalls>

<skills_available>

[List skills that this agent can use or delegate to]

- USE SKILL [skill-folder-name]

</skills_available>

<validation_and_quality_checks>

[Optional, KEEP THIS VERY SHORT. define validation steps and quality criteria, do NOT repeat/rephrase the prompt: prompt tells what to do, while validation provides proof it was done correctly without restating]

</validation_and_quality_checks>

<output_template>

[Define what the agent produces, provide template of the output if possible]

</output_template>

<examples>

[Optional]

<example_1_scenario_name>

**Input:**
```
[example input]
```

**Expected Output:**
```
