# plugin-generator — Glossary

One meaning per term. Used consistently across all requirement files.

- **Release** — A versioned line of instructions (`r2`, `r3`). Selects the instruction source line and a set of template variables. Default `r2`.
- **Domain** — The layer folder under a release that holds instruction content (`core`, or an organization overlay such as `acme`). Default `core`. The instruction source resolves to `instructions/<release>/<domain>/`.
- **Instruction source** — The resolved, possibly merged, tree of instruction files (`agents/`, `rules/`, `skills/`, `workflows/`, `configure/`, `templates/`) used as input for every target.
- **Layer merge** — Combining a base domain with one or more overlay domains so overlay files override or extend base files at the same relative path, mirroring the server-side Bundler. (New capability.)
- **Plugin variant / Target** — One generated distribution for one IDE delivery mode: `core-claude`, `core-cursor`, `core-copilot`, `core-codex`, `core-cursor-standalone`, `core-copilot-standalone`.
- **Standalone** — A target whose output is laid out under the IDE's in-repo subfolder (`.cursor/`, `.github/`) for direct extraction into a project, as opposed to marketplace installation. Differs from a "main" target only by its transform spec and output layout, not by how it is generated.
- **Preserved file** — A file a target keeps but does not generate from the instruction source: the IDE manifest (`plugin.json`), hook templates (`*.tmpl`), IDE config-folder contents, and any `.mcp.json`. It does not "survive" the wipe; `pluginCleanup` empties the output and `pluginCopy` re-seeds it each run from the preserved-file source.
- **Preserved-file source** — The committed input under `src/rosettify-plugins/plugins/<target>/`, mirroring the output-relative layout, that holds all of a target's preserved files. It is the authority for those files and is copied into the target output before generation so a target can be built into a clean or empty output directory (DATA-CFG-0005, FR-SEED-0001).
- **Model normalization** — Rewriting a source document's frontmatter `model:` value into the target IDE's model vocabulary.
- **Agent file** — A document under `agents/<name>.md` describing a subagent.
- **Bootstrap files** — The **ordered** set of rule/index documents whose stripped bodies are embedded into a target's session-start context, declared as an explicit ordered manifest (the `Bootstrap file manifest`). Order is significant and `plugin-files-mode` leads.
- **Bootstrap context payload** — The per-target, IDE-shaped session-start hook entries that inject bootstrap file bodies into the agent's context, emitted in the bootstrap-file-manifest order.
- **Bootstrap prefix** — A fixed lead-in string attached to the one designated lead bootstrap document of each target (the first bootstrap-classified entry in the manifest).
- **Template** — A Handlebars source file (`*.tmpl`) rendered to a sibling file with the `.tmpl` suffix removed, using release variables plus bootstrap payload values.
- **Hook bundle** — A pre-compiled per-IDE runtime hook artifact consumed from `src/hooks/dist/` and copied into a target's hook folder.
- **Deterministic hooks** — A per-release flag selecting whether advisory runtime hooks (and their bundles) are included (`r2`: off; `r3`: on). Overridable per run by a CLI argument (FR-CLI-0012).
- **Effective deterministic-hooks value** — The `deterministic_hooks` value after applying the CLI override where supplied, otherwise the release descriptor value. All gating and rendering reads this value (FR-CLI-0012, FR-HOOK-0020).
- **Folder index** — A generated `INDEX.md` listing a folder's documents with descriptions, used as a table of contents.
- **Transform spec** — The declarative per-target description of all adaptations (renames, normalizations, generated indexes, templates, layouts) applied to produce that target. See `MODEL.md`.
- **VirtualFile** — One entry in the VFS: a single prospective output file at a VFS path, holding an ordered collection of `SourceFile`s plus, during processing, its resolved target path, binary flag, and target contents. Class name: `VirtualFile`. (Rewrite term; use instead of the bare word "file".)
- **SourceFile** — One physical source file contributing to a `VirtualFile`: carries its absolute origin path, frontmatter, order key, and conditions. Class name: `SourceFile`. (Rewrite term.)
- **target_contents** — The resolved content a `pluginWrite()` would emit for a `VirtualFile`, with three distinct states: `null` = content removed (no file is written); `""` = file is written with empty main content (optional frontmatter only); a string or byte array = file is written with that content.

## Canonical type names (rewrite)

Precise terminology applies to **every** concept, not only files (FR-ARCH-0003). Each concept below maps to one named type:

- **PluginTarget** — one generated distribution (the six variants). Use instead of bare "plugin"/"target".
- **PluginSpec** — a `PluginTarget`'s full specification: the per-target descriptor fields (identity, output location and base subfolder, preserved-file seed source, `ModelVocabulary`, bootstrap manifest, hook config, index and injection declarations) plus an ordered list of `SpecEntry` and an ordered `PluginProcessor` pipeline.
- **SpecEntry** — `{source: glob, target: path, exclude: string[], processors: FileProcessor[]}`. The `target` is the destination folder (folder placement, e.g. `workflows`→`commands`); a filename/suffix change is a `fileRename()` `FileProcessor` in the entry; `exclude` lists VFS paths matched by `source` that must not be emitted (no source rename needed — the source files stay as-is for MCP and instruction references).
- **FileProcessor** — one pure, single-responsibility **file-tier** stage operating on a `FileProcessingFrame` (`fileRead`, `fileApplyOverrides`, `fileBundle`, per-vocabulary model-normalization processors, `fileRename`, `fileCodexAgentFormat`). `fileRename` changes only the path; `fileRead` is the only content ingress. Behavior that differs by case is a separate **case-specific processor** composed into the relevant spec's pipeline, not a branch (FR-ARCH-0005).
- **PluginProcessor** — one pure **plugin-tier** stage operating on a `PluginProcessingFrame` with whole-plugin visibility (`pluginCleanup`, `pluginCopy`, `pluginProcessSpecEntries`, `pluginRewriteReferences`, `pluginGenerateIndexes`, `pluginInjectSections`, `pluginAssembleBootstrap`, `pluginRenderTemplates`, `pluginWrite`). `pluginRewriteReferences` changes only content; `pluginWrite` is the only content egress.
- **FileProcessorPipeline / PluginPipeline** — ordered lists of `FileProcessor`s (within a `SpecEntry`) and `PluginProcessor`s (the `PluginSpec` pipeline) respectively.
- **Case-specific processor** — a `FileProcessor`/`PluginProcessor` written for one case (e.g. one IDE's hook entry shape or model vocabulary) and placed only in the pipeline(s) of the `PluginSpec`(s) that need it. The applicable case is selected by which processor a spec composes — not by a runtime branch. Logic common to several case-specific processors lives in shared low-level functions they compose (FR-ARCH-0005).
- **Identity-discriminant flag (forbidden)** — a descriptor/`PluginSpec` value whose value set enumerates IDE/target/case identities (e.g. `hookEntryShape`, `ModelVocabulary.kind`) or is otherwise derived from identity. It is the target name relabeled; branching on it is prohibited (FR-ARCH-0004, FR-ARCH-0005).
- **Genuine behavior flag (permitted)** — a `PluginSpec` value whose value set names a capability or outcome, not an identity (e.g. a deterministic-hooks toggle, a bootstrap/index-inclusion flag). Branching may rest on such a flag. Contrast with an identity-discriminant flag, which is forbidden (FR-ARCH-0005).
- **pluginCleanup (output wipe)** — the head `PluginProcessor` that empties a target output before seeding. Per-file removal of a prospective output is expressed by a processor setting `target_contents` to `null` so `pluginWrite()` produces no file. Nothing "survives the wipe": preserved files are re-established each run by `pluginCopy`.
- **pluginCopy (preserved-file seeding)** — the `PluginProcessor` that copies a target's committed preserved files from `src/rosettify-plugins/plugins/<target>/` into the output before instruction-derived content is produced; the seed source is the sole authority for them.
- **Bootstrap file manifest** — the ordered list of bootstrap/index documents whose bodies feed a target's session-start context. Its order is significant (see below): it fixes both the payload entry sequence and which document receives the bootstrap prefix.
- **FileProcessingFrame** — the per-file mutable working object passed through a `FileProcessorPipeline`: `{sourcePath, target, isBinary, target_contents, source: SourceFile[]}`. Distinct from the immutable `VirtualFile`.
- **PluginProcessingFrame** — the whole-plugin working object passed through the `PluginPipeline`: `{spec: PluginSpec, vfs: VirtualFile[], frames: FileProcessingFrame[], templateContext}`. A `PluginProcessor` reads across all `frames`; `templateContext` carries the render placeholders (release variables + assembled bootstrap payload values) from `pluginAssembleBootstrap` to `pluginRenderTemplates`.
- **VirtualFile** — an immutable VFS entry `{path, sourceFiles: SourceFile[]}` (defined above).
- **SourceFile** — a contributing physical source file (defined above).
- **FilenameDirective** — the tilde-fenced `~…~` segment (comma-separated tokens) in a source filename, e.g. `name.~1a,claude-only,overwrite~.ext`.
- **DirectiveToken** — one token inside a `FilenameDirective`; kinds: `OrderToken`, `TargetOnlyToken`, `OverwriteToken`.
- **SourceFileConditions** — the resolved conditions on a `SourceFile` (e.g. overwrite, target scoping) derived from its `DirectiveToken`s.
- **ModelVocabulary** — a per-IDE map (pure data) from logical model key to that IDE's model identifier, consumed by that target's model-normalization processor. It is data, not a branching discriminant (FR-ARCH-0005).
- **Release**, **Domain** — defined above; each is a named type.
