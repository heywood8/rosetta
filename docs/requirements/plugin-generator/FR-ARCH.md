# plugin-generator — FR: Target Architecture (VFS + Two-Tier Processor Pipeline)

Architecture requirements: the configuration-driven generation model — uniform spec contract, immutable flat VFS, filename directives, and the **two-tier** pure processor pipeline. A `FileProcessor` transforms one `FileProcessingFrame`; a `PluginProcessor` transforms the whole-plugin `PluginProcessingFrame` (which holds all of the target's `FileProcessingFrame`s), giving cross-file processors a whole-plugin view without recomputation or barriers. Naming: types are PascalCase; processor factory functions are camelCase and carry a `file`/`plugin` tier prefix. Per-case variation is expressed by composition — case-specific processors in specific specs plus shared low-level helpers — never by branching on IDE identity or an identity-discriminant flag (FR-ARCH-0004, FR-ARCH-0005). Terms: see `GLOSSARY.md`.

## Specification contract

<req id="FR-ARCH-0001" type="FR" level="System" ticketId="" classification="technical">
  <title>Uniform spec contract, values externalized</title>
  <statement>The generator shall define one specification contract used identically for every target — a `PluginSpec` — and shall store the concrete per-target values in a separate data module (`plugin-specs.ts`).</statement>
  <rationale>One contract + externalized data keeps every target generated the same way and additions data-only.</rationale>

  <title>SpecEntry and PluginSpec shape</title>
  <statement>Each `SpecEntry` shall declare `{source: glob, target: path, exclude: string[], processors: FileProcessor[]}` — a VFS-relative source glob, a target folder/path, a list of VFS paths to exclude from emission, and an ordered `FileProcessor` pipeline. A `PluginTarget`'s `PluginSpec` shall hold an ordered list of `SpecEntry`s, an ordered `PluginProcessor` pipeline, and the per-target descriptor values (identity, output location and base subfolder, preserved-file seed source, model vocabulary, bootstrap manifest, hook configuration, and index and injection declarations). A file's destination folder is the `SpecEntry` `target` (e.g. `workflows`→`commands`); a filename/suffix change is `fileRename()` within that entry's processors; a source file that must not ship is named in `exclude` (no source rename — the source files remain unchanged for MCP and instruction references). Per-case file behavior (e.g. model normalization, hook entry-shape emission) is selected by which `FileProcessor`s a `SpecEntry`/`PluginSpec` composes, not by an identity-discriminant field on the spec (FR-ARCH-0005).</statement>
  <rationale>Processing is expressed as source→target mappings (folder placement) with an explicit per-file processor chain, while whole-plugin steps and descriptor data live on the `PluginSpec`. `exclude` is data on the entry, so an overlay domain can own its own omissions and no source file has to be renamed.</rationale>

No processor name, branch, or constant shall name a concrete target (`core-cursor`), release (`r2`/`r3`), folder (`rules`/`workflows`), or instruction filename. Supplying specificity "as data" excludes an identity-discriminant flag — a descriptor value whose value set enumerates IDE/target/case identities (e.g. `hookEntryShape`, a `ModelVocabulary` `kind`) or that is otherwise derived from identity; such a flag is identity relabeled, and branching on it is prohibited (FR-ARCH-0005).</statement>

  <title>No identity branching or identity-discriminant flags; per-case variation by composition</title>
  <statement>No `FileProcessor` or `PluginProcessor` shall branch on a `PluginTarget`'s IDE/target identity (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Codex, or any specific target), and none shall branch on an identity-discriminant flag — a `PluginSpec`/descriptor value whose value set enumerates IDE/target/case identities (e.g. `hookEntryShape`, a `ModelVocabulary` `kind`) or that is otherwise derived from identity. Any branching a processor performs shall rest only on a genuine behavior flag that names a capability or outcome, never on identity. Per-case variation shall instead be expressed by composition: (a) each processor shall perform one small unit of work; (b) behavior that differs by case shall be a separate, case-specific processor placed only in the pipeline(s) of the `PluginSpec`(s) that require it, so the applicable case is selected by which processor the spec composes — not by a runtime branch; (c) logic shared across case-specific processors shall live in low-level reusable functions that each such processor composes, never duplicated and never routed through a shared identity-dispatching processor; and (d) behavior that applies only to specific paths shall be scoped by a `SpecEntry` source glob and that entry's processors (FR-ARCH-0002), never by a path test inside a shared processor.</statement>
  <rationale>FR-ARCH-0004's "all specificity as data" is met in spirit only when the data is a value, a map, or a composed case-specific processor; re-encoding identity as an enum and switching on it reintroduces the exact target-coupling FR-ARCH-0004 and NFR-0006 remove — an identity-discriminant flag is the target name relabeled.

The payload serialization shall reproduce the current generator's exact byte layout (NFR-0001).</statement>

All 4 assemblers call callback-driven assembleBootstrapPayload(p, buildEntry, buildRootEntry) and write templateContext['bootstrap_hooks'] (one fixed key). Cursor generates full bootstrap payload; cursor template omits {{{bootstrap_hooks}}} placeholder so payload is not injected — template decision per FR-VAR-0070.
