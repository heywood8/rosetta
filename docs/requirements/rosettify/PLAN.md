# FR-PLAN — Plan Command

Requirements for the plan command, reverse-engineered from plan_manager.js, plan_manager.py, plan_manager.test.js, SKILL.md, and pm-schema.md. plan_manager.js is absorbed into rosettify as the plan command module. Python implementation (plan_manager.py) provides additional validations adopted here.

Note: All "Output:" references in this file describe the `result` field contents of the common output envelope (FR-ARCH-0011). Envelope wrapping ({ok, result, error, include_help}) is handled by common functionality (FR-ARCH-0011, FR-ARCH-0012). Run delegates never touch stdin/stdout/stderr (FR-ARCH-0008).

</req>

### FR-PLAN-0011 next

<req id="FR-PLAN-0011" type="FR" level="System">
  <title>plan next subcommand</title>
  <statement>plan next SHALL return the steps that are actionable now plus scope-wide status counts, respecting sequential phase ordering. Phases are sequential: steps from a later phase SHALL NOT appear in next results until ALL steps in all earlier phases are complete (status=complete). The active phase is the earliest phase that is not yet fully complete. next operates on the active phase only, unless target_id overrides this.

The `next` array SHALL contain steps in priority order, then truncated to the limit: (1) in_progress steps — interrupted work to continue; (2) open steps whose step dependencies and parent-phase dependencies are all satisfied — new work; (3) blocked steps; (4) failed steps — surfaced so the caller can reason about them. Each returned step carries its own `status` (in_progress, open, blocked, or failed), which the caller reads to decide what to do. Because groups (1) and (2) come first, when there is enough actionable work to fill the limit the blocked and failed groups are truncated and do not appear in that call; the `Overall*` count fields still report that they exist. To list all blocked/failed/in_progress steps regardless of the limit, the caller uses show_status (which lists every step with its status and is not bounded by limit), then query for a single step's full detail. Each returned step SHALL be the named exported type `PlanNextStep` carrying id, name, prompt, status, depends_on, phase_id, phase_name, and any set subagent, role, and model. `PlanNextStep` SHALL be the declared `items` type of the `next` array per the recursive naming rule (FR-HELP-0002).

The result SHALL be the named type `PlanNextResult` with fields:

- `parent` (the named exported type `PlanPhaseContext`, present ONLY when target_id is provided): the scalar fields of the targeted phase — id, name, description, status, depends_on, and any set subagent/role/model — and SHALL NOT include the phase's steps. It gives the caller the context of the steps it is working on. Its `status` is the phase-scoped completion signal: under target_id the phase is finished when `count` is 0 and `parent.status` is complete; without target_id the caller relies on `plan_status` instead. `PlanPhaseContext` SHALL be a named exported type per the recursive naming rule (FR-HELP-0002).
- `next` (array of `PlanNextStep`): the steps described above, in priority order and truncated to the limit.
- `count` (integer): the number of steps returned in `next` (the array length after any limit is applied), not the total actionable count.
- `plan_status` (StatusEnum): the derived status of the whole plan.
- `OverallOpenCount`, `OverallInProgressCount`, `OverallBlockedCount`, `OverallFailedCount`, `OverallCompleteCount` (integers): the number of steps in each status within the current scope.

The optional target_id parameter acts as a filter. When provided: results and all `Overall*` counts are scoped to that phase only, and the `parent` block is included. When omitted: next selects the active phase per sequential ordering, the `Overall*` counts cover the entire plan, and the `parent` block is absent.

next SHALL accept an optional limit parameter (default 3) bounding the number of steps in the `next` array; callers MAY pass a larger explicit limit, and when no limit is supplied by any means the default 3 SHALL apply on every frontend. On the CLI the limit is supplied as a positional argument, which is the only documented form. For compatibility with callers that reflexively pass a flag, the CLI SHALL ALSO accept the limit via a `--limit <n>` option; this option is an undocumented compatibility alias ONLY and SHALL NOT appear in help, schemas, usage strings, examples, notes, or any emitted output. When both the positional limit and the `--limit` alias are supplied, the positional value SHALL take precedence. A negative limit SHALL be rejected with `invalid_limit`. Errors: plan_not_found (file missing), target_not_found (target_id references a nonexistent phase).</statement>
  <rationale>Phases are sequential by design: an AI agent must not start later-phase work until earlier phases are fully done. The `Overall*` counts give the AI a recovery signal that is independent of the limit: a non-zero blocked/failed count, or an in_progress count that does not fall across calls (a stuck step), tells the agent to look — and because the limit can truncate the blocked/failed groups out of a given call, show_status is the reliable way to list them all. target_id remains a filter (not globally required) so the same command serves whole-plan orchestration and phase-scoped subagent execution; the `parent` block lets a filtered subagent see its phase context without a second call. Default limit 3 matches the intended small-batch subagent cadence while remaining overridable. The undocumented `--limit` alias absorbs the common reflex of passing a flag — a model that types `--limit` should not hit an error — without advertising a second way to do the same thing; the positional form stays the single documented surface and wins on conflict, so the documented form remains authoritative. Diverges from both JS and Python sources, which do not enforce sequential phase ordering, scope counts, or a parent block.</rationale>

`PlanStatusTotals` SHALL be {open, in_progress, complete, blocked, failed, total, progress_pct}. `total` is the count of all items in scope regardless of status (including blocked and failed); progress_pct = round(complete / total * 1000) / 10, i.e. the percentage of in-scope items that are complete, to one decimal place, and 0 when total is 0. `PlanPhaseSummary` ({id, name, status, steps: array of `PlanStepSummary`}) and `PlanStepSummary` ({id, name, status}) SHALL be named exported types reused wherever the same phase/step status summary appears (e.g. PlanWriteResult), per the recursive naming and SRP+DRY rules (FR-HELP-0002). `PlanStepDetail` SHALL likewise be a named exported type; it is distinct from `PlanStepSummary` (it adds depends_on and the optional subagent fields) and from the full `Step` (it omits prompt).

Parameters 2, 4, and 5 are template placeholder values and SHALL be passed under the kebab-case names shown (FR-PLAN-0034). CLI accepts them positionally in the order above. MCP receives them as named fields on the plan tool's input object under the same names.

Parameter 6 `phase-steps` is a JSON array of additional steps injected into the seeded phase per FR-PLAN-0043; it is not a placeholder value and is not subject to FR-PLAN-0034 matching.

The subcommand SHALL look up `template` in the upsert-kind template collection (FR-PLAN-0033); a name not found in that collection SHALL be rejected with `invalid_template`. It SHALL render the template via FR-PLAN-0034 with `[phase-id]`, `[phase-name]`, and `[phase-description]` as the only allowed placeholders, then invoke the same logic as plan upsert (FR-PLAN-0015) targeting `phase-id` with the rendered phase JSON as the patch data. All upsert merge semantics, validations, write semantics (FR-PLAN-0024), and result shape (FR-PLAN-0040) SHALL be identical to plan upsert.</statement>
  <rationale>A wrapper over upsert keeps merge and write semantics consistent. Exposing `phase-id` as a placeholder-bound input lets the same template apply to any phase in any plan and keeps step IDs unique under repeated use.</rationale>

### FR-PLAN-0016 Plan Help Content

  <title>Help content registered for the plan command</title>
  <statement>The plan command SHALL register help content in the tool registry that the help system (FR-HELP-0002) returns when queried. The content SHALL include:

- plan_file convention
- core concepts (hierarchy, statuses, depends_on, status_propagation). The status_propagation concept SHALL state the derivation precedence: a parent is complete only when all children are complete; otherwise failed outranks blocked, blocked outranks in_progress, and in_progress outranks open (FR-PLAN-0003)
- subagent_fields (subagent, role, model on phases and steps)
- subcommands: one entry per registered subcommand (create, next, update_status, show_status, query, upsert, create-with-template, upsert-with-template, list-templates), each with name, brief, usage, args, description, an examples block, and a statement of which inputs are required. Required-ness SHALL be expressed per subcommand rather than as a single global required set; where it is conditional, the condition SHALL be stated — in particular, for upsert `kind` is required only when the target id does not already exist, and `phase_id` is required only when `kind` is `step`. Every examples block SHALL contain at least two example invocations for the subcommand:
  - a **tip example** using bracketed self-explanatory hints in place of each argument. The bracketed hints describe what each argument represents in plain words and SHALL NOT be confused with template placeholder names (which match JSON field names per FR-PLAN-0034). Where a placeholder name is already self-explanatory it may be reused as-is (e.g. `[plan-name]`); where it is too generic it SHALL be expanded into a longer human hint (e.g. `[user-request-description-one-sentence]` rather than `[plan-description]`).
  - a **real example** using concrete quoted values that would produce a working invocation.

- limits per FR-PLAN-0005
- templates: the catalog returned by list-templates (FR-PLAN-0032), grouped by kind
- notes: the notes array defined in FR-PLAN-0042
- plan_authoring_guidance: "the last step in each phase should verify all work in that phase was actually completed; the last phase should verify all work across the entire plan was completed"

### FR-PLAN-0042 Plan Help Notes Content

<req id="FR-PLAN-0042" type="FR" level="System">
  <title>Notes array content for plan help</title>
  <statement>The plan command's help content SHALL include a `notes` string array documenting behaviors that affect the caller upfront. The notes SHALL include at minimum:

- status fields in upsert patches are silently dropped — use update_status to change status one-by-one after each task completion
- write-cycle process (high level): read with retries → modify in memory → rename old file as backup → write new file
- every successful write atomically renames the plan file to `<plan_file>.bakNNN` before writing the new plan; the plan's `previous_version` field points to the immediately prior version (the backup captured at write time)
- backup retention is bounded; the oldest backups beyond the configured limit (default 5) are pruned
- if the plan file is missing but at least one backup exists, reads retry briefly before returning `plan_not_found`
- templates have two kinds (create, upsert); a template of one kind cannot be used with the other kind
- placeholder syntax in templates is `[placeholder-name]`; provided params and declared placeholders must match exactly
- end-to-end usage — build the whole execution plan first, then execute. Build: (1) create the plan and its initial preparation phase with create-with-template, passing the actual phase-steps (the main body of work) to fill that first phase in one call; (2) add each subsequent phase (phase 1, phase 2, …) with upsert-with-template, every call passing the actual phase-steps so the phase arrives complete — the seeded subagent bootstrap steps plus the actual phase-steps; always add every follow-up phase with upsert-with-template (never plain upsert for a new phase); use plain upsert only for follow-up steps and patching existing items (rarely); change status only via update_status; (3) keep steps granular — each step is about 3–5 minutes of an AI coding agent's own work. Execute only after the whole execution plan is built: (4) hand each phase to its subagent, which loops — call next with --target <its phase id> for the next small batch, update_status <step_id> in_progress before starting a step and update_status <step_id> complete once it passes; (5) a phase is finished when next returns count 0 and parent.status is complete; if blocked or failed steps remain, recover them before finishing
- phase-scoped next: when working a single phase always call next with --target <that phase id> so the batch and all the counts cover only that phase; --target may be passed with or without a limit
- what next returns: next lists steps in priority order — in_progress, then ready open, then blocked, then failed — and cuts the list off at limit (default 3). Because in_progress and open steps come first, when there is enough work to do the blocked and failed steps get cut off and won't appear in that call. The Overall*Count fields are a headcount of every status in scope (open, in_progress, blocked, failed, complete) — a reminder of what exists even when the limit hid some
- three outcomes of a next call: if count is greater than 0, work the returned steps; if count is 0 and the scope is complete (parent.status complete under --target, otherwise plan_status complete), the scope is done; if count is 0 but blocked or failed steps remain, stop looping and recover them
- recover blocked, failed, or stuck steps: when OverallBlockedCount or OverallFailedCount is non-zero, or OverallInProgressCount does not fall across calls (a stuck in_progress step), call show_status with --target <phase id> to list every step with its status — it has no limit, so it scales to any number of steps — then for each blocked, failed, or stuck step call query <step_id> for full detail, re-review and re-verify the work, and retry it by resetting its status with update_status <step_id> open (or in_progress) so next surfaces it again; do not finish the phase while any blocked or failed step remains

Every note SHALL be standalone directive guidance for the caller and SHALL NOT contain requirement identifiers, internal paths, internal module names, or authoring rationale (FR-ARCH-0016).</statement>
  <rationale>Splitting the notes obligation out of the help-content manifest makes the note set independently testable and is the home for the caller-facing behavior the AI must understand: the end-to-end build-and-execute flow, what next returns, what the counts mean, the three outcomes of a next call, and how to recover blocked/failed/stuck steps by resetting their status at any scale.</rationale>

## Output Shapes

### FR-PLAN-0040 PlanWriteResult Output for Write Subcommands

<req id="FR-PLAN-0040" type="FR" level="System">
  <title>PlanWriteResult output shape shared by all write subcommands</title>
  <statement>All write subcommands (create, upsert, create-with-template, upsert-with-template) SHALL return the same named type `PlanWriteResult` — a single shared shape (per the SRP+DRY type rule in FR-HELP-0002), defined once and reused, that summarizes the plan after the write. There SHALL NOT be a separate per-subcommand write-result type. The shape SHALL be:

```
{
  "plan": { "name": <string>, "status": <StatusEnum>, "previous_version": <string | null> },
  "phases": [
    {
      "id": <string>,
      "name": <string>,
      "status": <StatusEnum>,
      "steps": [
        { "id": <string>, "name": <string>, "status": <StatusEnum> }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The plan summary SHALL carry `previous_version`: the filesystem path of the backup captured at this write (FR-PLAN-0024), or `null` when the write produced the first version (no backup yet). It is surfaced inside the plan summary of every write result so a caller discovers the backup link directly from the output it already reads, without a follow-up query. The plan document's own `previous_version` field (FR-PLAN-0017, FR-PLAN-0024) remains the source of truth and the backwards-traversable recovery chain; the value in the write result equals the plan document's value for that write. The write result SHALL contain only `plan` and `phases` (with `steps`) and no other top-level properties. Each nested shape SHALL be a named exported type per the recursive naming rule in FR-HELP-0002: the plan summary is the named type `PlanSummary` ({name, status, previous_version}), each phase summary is `PlanPhaseSummary`, and each step summary is `PlanStepSummary`. Where these summaries are structurally identical to summaries returned by other subcommands (the phase/step status summaries in show_status), the same shared types SHALL be reused (SRP+DRY).</statement>
  <rationale>AI agents need a compact post-write snapshot to reason about plan state without re-reading the full plan, and they act on outputs rather than on documentation — so the backup link belongs in the write result where it is self-discoverable, not only on the plan file reachable via a separate query. Placing `previous_version` inside the plan summary keeps the plan's current state (name, status, prior-version link) cohesive in one object and consistent with the field name on the plan document. The plan document remains the canonical recovery chain. One shared PlanWriteResult type (SRP+DRY) avoids four structurally identical result types.</rationale>

### FR-PLAN-0043 phase-steps array injection

<req id="FR-PLAN-0043" type="FR" level="System" classification="technical">
  <title>phase-steps array injection for template subcommands</title>
  <statement>create-with-template (FR-PLAN-0030) and upsert-with-template (FR-PLAN-0031) SHALL accept a required `phase-steps` input: a JSON string that SHALL parse to an array of step objects. The parsed array SHALL be appended, in order, to the end of the seeded `steps` array of the template's phase — for create-with-template the plan's `ph-prep` phase, for upsert-with-template the upserted phase — after placeholder substitution (FR-PLAN-0034) completes. Injected step objects SHALL be inserted verbatim; their `id` values SHALL NOT be rewritten or prefixed. An empty array SHALL be valid and SHALL leave the seeded steps unchanged. Callers SHALL pass `phase-steps`, and usage and help present it as required; for backward compatibility, if `phase-steps` is omitted the subcommand SHALL treat it as an empty array (equivalent to `[]`) rather than reject the call. If `phase-steps` is present but is not valid JSON, or parses to a value that is not an array, the subcommand SHALL be rejected with `invalid_phase_steps`. Field-level validation of each injected step (required id/name/prompt, plan-wide id uniqueness per FR-PLAN-0001) SHALL be performed by the downstream create (FR-PLAN-0010) or upsert (FR-PLAN-0015) logic on the assembled plan, not by the injection. phase-steps SHALL NOT be a template placeholder and SHALL NOT participate in the strict bidirectional placeholder matching of FR-PLAN-0034.</statement>
  <rationale>A template seeds only the mandatory bootstrap steps; the caller completes the phase by supplying the remaining workflow steps in the same call, so a template subcommand emits a full, ready-to-run phase. Array injection is structurally distinct from string placeholder substitution: it splices objects into an array, which literal string replacement cannot express. Keeping IDs verbatim gives the caller full control and reuses the existing duplicate-id guard.</rationale>

### FR-PLAN-0033 Template Registry

<req id="FR-PLAN-0033" type="FR" level="System">
  <title>Compiled-in template registry, two kinds, per-file modules</title>
  <statement>The plan command SHALL expose a template registry with exactly two kinds: `create` and `upsert`. Templates of one kind SHALL NOT be usable as templates of the other kind. The registry SHALL be assembled at build time from individual TypeScript modules located under `src/commands/plan/templates/create/` and `src/commands/plan/templates/upsert/`. Each template SHALL be a separate source file exporting a single template module. The two kind-scoped collections SHALL be assembled into a dictionary keyed by template name. Templates SHALL be compiled into the published npm package; the running command SHALL NOT read template files from the filesystem at runtime.</statement>
  <rationale>Co-located, per-file modules give clear authoring boundaries and reviewable diffs. Two strictly separated kinds prevent semantically invalid cross-use (a plan-shaped template cannot be applied as a phase, and vice versa). Build-time bundling eliminates runtime filesystem dependencies and keeps the npm package self-contained.</rationale>

### FR-PLAN-0034 Template Placeholder Substitution

<req id="FR-PLAN-0034" type="FR" level="System">
  <title>Placeholder syntax, parameter naming, and strict bidirectional matching</title>
  <statement>Templates SHALL use the placeholder syntax `[placeholder-name]` where `placeholder-name` is a kebab-case identifier. Each template SHALL declare the exact set of placeholder names it consumes.

Parameter naming SHALL be uniform across CLI, MCP, and the template engine: the name of each input parameter SHALL be identical to its corresponding placeholder name (without the brackets). The canonical form is kebab-case.

The render operation SHALL build a parameter dictionary keyed by placeholder name and value-substitute every occurrence of each declared placeholder in the template's JSON content. Matching SHALL be strict and bidirectional:

- If the template declares a placeholder for which no value is provided by the caller, the render SHALL fail with `missing_template_param`.
- If the caller provides a value for which no matching declared placeholder exists in the template, the render SHALL fail with `unexpected_template_param`.
- If the template's JSON content contains a placeholder token that is not in its declared set, the render SHALL fail with `unexpected_template_param`.

All input parameters for the template-using subcommands (FR-PLAN-0030, FR-PLAN-0031) SHALL be required. Substitution SHALL be literal string replacement; values SHALL NOT be re-interpreted or escaped beyond what JSON syntax requires to keep the rendered template a valid JSON document. Injection of caller-supplied steps via `phase-steps` is governed by FR-PLAN-0043 and is not part of placeholder substitution.</statement>
  <rationale>A single canonical name spanning CLI positionals, MCP input fields, and template placeholders eliminates translation layers, prevents drift, and makes mistakes self-evident. Strict bidirectional matching catches both caller errors (forgot a param) and template authoring errors (template uses a placeholder caller cannot supply), eliminating silent template misuse.</rationale>

The template SHALL declare the placeholders `[phase-id]`, `[phase-name]`, and `[phase-description]`. The template's JSON content SHALL be byte-equivalent to the canonical asset stored at `assets/templates/upsert-for-subagent.json` (relative to this requirements directory). The rendered output SHALL be a single phase whose step IDs are prefixed by `[phase-id]-s-` (e.g. `[phase-id]-s-load-context-instructions`) so that the template can be upserted to multiple phases in the same plan without producing duplicate step IDs. The template SHALL declare a one-line `produces` summary (FR-PLAN-0032) describing this rendered output.</statement>

### FR-PLAN-0024 Atomic Write with Mutex, Backup Chain, and Bounded Retry

<req id="FR-PLAN-0024" type="FR" level="System">
  <title>Atomic plan write with cross-process mutex, backup chain, and bounded retry</title>
  <statement>Every successful plan-file mutation SHALL execute the following cycle under cross-process mutual exclusion:

0. Acquire a cross-process exclusive mutex over the plan file. The mutex SHALL be implemented as an atomic-create primitive (e.g. `mkdir(2)` on a `<plan_file>.lock` directory, or an equivalent `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` file marker) — NOT as a rename or hardlink, both of which do not provide cross-process mutual exclusion (see "Concurrency primitive constraints" below). On EEXIST the writer SHALL back off briefly (jittered ~20 ms) and retry. A mutex held longer than 30 seconds SHALL be considered stale and MAY be reclaimed by another writer.
1. Read the current plan from the plan file (subject to FR-SHRD-0009 read resilience).
2. Apply the requested mutation in memory.
3. Compute the next backup name as `<plan_file>.bakNNN` where NNN is the lowest non-negative 3-digit-zero-padded integer greater than the highest existing matching backup index in the same directory.
4. Set the in-memory plan's `previous_version` field to the computed backup path.
5. Rename the plan file to the computed backup name. Inside the mutex this rename is contention-free and unambiguous (no other writer is in the cycle).
6. Write the new plan content to the plan file path. The on-disk format SHALL follow FR-PLAN-0026.
7. Prune backup files in the same directory so that no more than the configured retention count (default 5) remain. The most recent backups SHALL be kept; the oldest SHALL be deleted.
8. Release the mutex.

The cycle SHALL be wrapped in a bounded retry loop. Any failure within the cycle — including but not limited to mutex acquisition contention, a write error, or a post-mutation validation failure caused by a re-read race — SHALL restart the cycle from step 0 with a fresh mutex attempt and a fresh read. The retry loop SHALL NOT skip steps or attempt partial recovery. The retry loop SHALL be bounded to 50 attempts; on exhaustion the cycle SHALL return `backup_create_failed`.

**Concurrency primitive constraints (lessons learned, MUST NOT regress):**

- `fs.renameSync` (POSIX `rename(2)`) **overwrites** an existing destination silently. Two concurrent writers that pick the same `bakNNN` slot would both succeed and clobber each other's backup AND each other's just-written plan — a real, reproducible lost-write under multi-process load.
- `fs.linkSync` (POSIX `link(2)`) is atomic and fails with EEXIST on a taken destination, so it serializes claims of a specific destination name. It does NOT serialize the read-mutate-write cycle as a whole: two writers can both successfully hardlink the same source inode to two different bak names before either unlinks the source, after which the second writer's `unlinkSync` destroys the first writer's freshly-written inode — also a real, reproducible lost-write under multi-process load.
- Only an atomic-create primitive (mkdir of a lock directory, or O_CREAT|O_EXCL of a lock file) provides cross-process mutex semantics on POSIX without requiring an external service.

Implementations SHALL NOT use plain rename or plain hardlink as the cycle's exclusion primitive. A regression to either pattern SHALL be treated as a contract violation.</statement>
  <rationale>Multi-process AI agents legitimately write the same plan file concurrently (parallel subagents, retried tool calls). The cycle's prior incarnations using rename or hardlink were both proven to lose writes under real multi-process tests at modest concurrency (1/10 with rename, 3/30 with hardlink). A mkdir-based mutex serializes the cycle correctly, has no extra dependencies, and recovers from crashed holders via a stale-lock timeout. The `previous_version` field continues to form a backwards-traversable history that AI agents can use for recovery.</rationale>
