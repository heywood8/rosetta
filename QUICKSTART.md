# Quick Start

**Who is this for?** New users setting up Rosetta for the first time.
**When should I read this?** When you want to go from zero to a working setup.

---

## Step 1: Connect Rosetta MCP

> [!CAUTION]
> You must receive a prior approval from your manager and company to use it.

> [!WARNING]
> Use **Sonnet 4.6**, **GPT-5.4-medium**, **gemini-3.1-pro** or better models. Avoid Auto model selection.

> [!NOTE]
> Rosetta is designed to never use or see data or IP.
> Instead it uses inversion of control, by providing a "menu" to AI coding agents.
> There will be conflict if you have similar plugins installed: JUXT, Superpowers, GSD, AI-DevKit. Use the ones you have the most experience with.


Rosetta uses HTTP MCP transport with OAuth. Pick your IDE and add the configuration.

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor</b></summary>

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global) or `.cursor/mcp.json` (project):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Rosetta": {
      "url": "https://mcp.rosetta.griddynamics.net/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b></summary>

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http Rosetta https://mcp.rosetta.griddynamics.net/mcp
```

Authenticate inside a claude session with `/mcp`, select Rosetta, Authenticate, and complete the OAuth flow.

<summary><b>JetBrains Junie</b></summary>

`Settings` > `Tools` > `Junie` > `MCP Settings` > `+ Add` > `As JSON`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {

    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windsurf</b></summary>

Add to your Windsurf MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Rosetta": {
      "url": "https://mcp.rosetta.griddynamics.net/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Antigravity</b></summary>

Add to your Antigravity MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Rosetta": {
      "serverUrl": "https://mcp.rosetta.griddynamics.net/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OpenCode</b></summary>

Add to `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "Rosetta": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.rosetta.griddynamics.net/mcp",
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

Any MCP client that supports HTTP transport can connect using the endpoint URL. Complete the OAuth flow when prompted.

STDIO transport is available for air-gapped environments. See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md).

## Step 2: Verify

Ask the agent:

```
What can you do, Rosetta?
```

It should use Rosetta MCP to retrieve agents, guardrails, and instructions:

<img src="docs/images/Rosetta-ProperResponse1.png" alt="Rosetta proper response" width="355"/> <img src="docs/images/Rosetta-ProperResponse2.png" alt="Rosetta proper response" width="300"/>

## Step 3: Initialize (once per repository)

Ask the agent:

```
Initialize this repository using Rosetta
```

The agent will analyze your tech stack, generate documentation (TECHSTACK.md, CODEMAP.md, DEPENDENCIES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CONTEXT.md), and ask clarifying questions. Read more about [workspace files](INSTALLATION.md#workspace-files-created) and [all workflows](USAGE_GUIDE.md#workflows).

> [!NOTE]
> **Prefer medium models:** High reasoning and Opus models consume too much token on reasoning.
> **Composite workspaces:** init each repository separately, then init at the workspace level with "This is composite workspace" appended.
> **Dead code or existing specs:** mention their location in the prompt to save time.

## Step 4: Add Bootstrap Rule (optional)

If something does not work.

Download [bootstrap.md](https://github.com/griddynamics/rosetta/blob/main/instructions/r2/core/rules/bootstrap.md?plain=1) and add it to your IDE's instruction file (keep entire contents, including YAML frontmatter):

| IDE                        | Destination                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Cursor                     | `.cursor/rules/bootstrap.mdc`     |
| Claude Code                | `.claude/claude.md`               |
| VS Code / GitHub Copilot   | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| GitHub Copilot (JetBrains) | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| JetBrains Junie            | `.junie/guidelines.md`            |
| Windsurf                   | `.windsurf/rules/bootstrap.md`    |
| Antigravity                | `.agent/rules/bootstrap.md`       |
| OpenCode/Cursor            | `AGENTS.md`                       |

## Rosetta Prompt Examples

- "Use Rosetta `coding-flow.md` to implement/fix/identify ..."

- "Extract business and technical requirements from community id ... name ... (name of community is similar to controller name, but you include all community controllers) using `requirements-authoring-flow.md` and appropriate available subagents."

- "Perform modernization phase 1 for library refsrc/... using `modernization-flow.md` and appropriate available subagents. Must use `coding-flow.md` as the main flow for `Phase 8 - Implementation`. As the very last spawn subagent to review and validate outputs." 
  Note, during migration all phases are must. All phases to be implemented one-by-one with proper review. Phase 3: Pre-Modernization Test Coverage is a must (and must include both unit and integration tests)

- "Perform modernization of community id ... named ... (name of community is similar to controller name, but you include all community controllers) using `modernization-flow.md` and appropriate available subagents. Microservice name is ... . As the very last spawn subagent to review and validate outputs."

## Common Issues

- **OAuth prompt does not appear:** restart your IDE and retry the connection. Read more in [Troubleshooting — Connection & Authentication](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#connection--authentication).
- **Agent ignores Rosetta tools:** confirm the MCP server shows as connected in your IDE's MCP settings. Add a [bootstrap rule](INSTALLATION.md) if the agent still skips Rosetta. Read more in [Troubleshooting — Agent Not Using Rosetta](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#agent-not-using-rosetta).
- **Slow or empty responses:** check your network can reach your Rosetta MCP host. See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#slow-or-empty-responses).
