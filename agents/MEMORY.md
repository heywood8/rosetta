## Preventive Rules

### Read Every File You Cite; Don't Dress Up Native Agent Mechanics As Rosetta Design [ACTIVE]
Rosetta's always-INJECTED footprint = the named bootstrap rules (`bootstrap-core-policy`, `-execution-policy`, `-guardrails`, `-hitl-questioning`, `-rosetta-files`) + exactly one mode file (`bootstrap.md` MCP xor `plugin-files-mode.md` plugins/standalone) — per `pa-rosetta-intro-for-AI.md`. Everything else (skills/workflows/agents) loads ON DEMAND; the host agent surfaces skill name+description and auto-loads 1–2 skill bodies from those descriptions — that is NATIVE coding-agent behavior (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), NOT a Rosetta-injected "channel," so never frame it as one. Guardrail chain: the always-on `bootstrap-guardrails` rule instructs loading the on-demand `hitl`/`sensitive-data`/etc. skills (`pa-rosetta.md:10`); shrinking that rule toward 0 shifts reliance onto native description auto-activation (= `skills-refactoring.md` W5). Process root cause: while reviewing `reduce-bootstrap.md` I (a) cited `pa-rosetta.md`/`pa-rosetta-intro-for-AI.md` as edit targets WITHOUT reading them, and (b) invented a "two always-on channels" insight out of basic agent mechanics. Always read every reference file before asserting about it; don't theorize platform behavior you already know.

### Story/Spec Authoring Means Doing The Analysis, Not Deferring It [ACTIVE]
When asked to author a task/story/spec for a refactor, the deliverable is the SOLUTION, not a task shell that defers every call to a future "analysis" phase. First mine canonical definitions (`docs/definitions/*.md`), prior art (`docs/stories/`, `docs/TODO.md`, `agents/MEMORY.md`, git log), and build a real usage map (grep `USE SKILL`/`ACQUIRE`) — then commit to concrete, evidence-cited verdicts (per-item table) with reasoned defaults marked overridable. Root-cause incident: produced a skills-refactoring story with generic multiple-choice "grilling" and "decide in analysis later" bullets, having skipped `docs/definitions/skills.md` (the source of truth) which revealed 12 off-list skills + 15 unbuilt + naming drift. Grilling must be earned from findings (e.g. "init-workspace-* are thin ACQUIRE+EXECUTE wrappers" or "guardrails are rule-invoked so descriptions are trimmable"), not asked blind.

### Verify Third-Party SDK Signatures Before Injecting kwargs Via A Wrapper [ACTIVE]
Confirm the real method signature of any third-party SDK method before injecting kwargs through a monkey-patch wrapper. SDK methods that do NOT declare a kwarg (e.g. RAGFlow `get/post/...` do not accept `timeout`) will raise `TypeError` at runtime when an injected kwarg is forwarded. mypy cannot catch this when the wrapper uses `**kwargs` passthrough. Always read the actual installed source (site-packages or refsrc) and quote the line — do not rely on docs or assumptions. If the kwarg is unsupported by the SDK method, inject it at the underlying transport layer instead (e.g. `requests.sessions.Session.request` for any requests-based SDK).

### Do Not Manufacture Approval Questions For Unrequested, Unchanged Details [ACTIVE]
Only surface decisions the user actually owns. Pre-existing behavior the user did not ask to change (e.g. existing `next` step flags resume/previously_blocked/previously_failed) must be left untouched and NOT raised as "needs your nod." Re-raising settled or out-of-scope items reads as churn and erodes trust. Before listing an item as open, check: did the user ask to change THIS? If no, leave it as-is and stay silent.

### Emitted Recommendations Are Directive — No Optionality/Internal Qualifiers [ACTIVE]
In emitted guidance/notes, state the recommended action directly ("call show_status with --target <id>"), never qualify it with optionality or internal mechanics ("optionally", "not required", "technically"). Whether a parameter is optional belongs in that parameter's own spec/args doc, not in a recommendation note. Adding the qualifier silently turns a recommendation into "you may skip this." Same root family as leaking author rationale into outputs: keep author-facing facts out of caller-facing directives.

### Answer "How Does The Caller Get X" With Caller-Visible Commands Only [ACTIVE]
When a user asks how a CALLER/USER obtains something from a command, answer only with caller-visible invocations, parameters, output fields, and a concrete example. Never cite internal code flags, variable names, or file internals — not part of the caller contract, only confuse. Read the implementation first to ground behavior, then translate to the caller's vocabulary. Root cause of a real incident: explained `plan next` retrieval using internal `resume`/`previously_*` flags instead of the caller-facing `next`→`show_status`→`query` flow, and re-derived behavior from a self-proposed option instead of the code.

### Prefer HTTPS Metadata Links Over `mailto:` Package URLs [ACTIVE]
Modern package validation can reject `mailto:` entries in `project.urls`; keep support links as HTTPS URLs and put raw email addresses in docs instead.

### Verify Nested Workflow Runtimes Before Closing CI Migrations [ACTIVE]
GitHub Actions runtime cleanup must inspect both local `uses:` refs and referenced reusable workflows, and confirm upstream `runs.using` values directly before marking the repo migrated.

### Use Override Inputs When Third-Party Actions Vendor Deprecated Tool Installers [ACTIVE]
If an upstream composite action exposes a path override for an internal runtime like Bun, preinstall the tool in-repo and pass the resolved executable instead of waiting on the vendor to refresh its bundled installer.

### Clear Live Auth Environment Triggers In Unit Test Fixtures [ACTIVE]
When env vars can trigger real authentication, add an autouse fixture that strips them so CI and local unit suites never reach shared services by accident.

### Approved Workaround Shape Wins Over Narrower Substitutions [ACTIVE]
When a user explicitly approves a concrete workaround implementation shape, execute that shape or ask before deviating; do not silently replace it with a “safer” variant.

### Wait For PyPI Visibility Before Publishing Dependent Packages [ACTIVE]
When one package pins a just-published sibling package version, gate the dependent publish on the upstream PyPI JSON endpoint returning 200 for that exact version instead of trusting workflow completion timing alone.

### Never Directly Edit Plugin Files — Always Edit Source Instructions [ACTIVE]
`plugins/` content is fully regenerated by `scripts/pre_commit.py`; any direct edit is overwritten on the next sync. Edit `instructions/r2/core/...` first, then run the script.

### Complete ALL Prep Steps Before Any Action [ACTIVE]
Prep Step 2 requires reading both `CONTEXT.md` AND `ARCHITECTURE.md` in full before proceeding. Skipping either leads to wrong execution path (e.g., editing generated files instead of source files).

### NEVER Run git stash / stash pop Without Explicit User Permission [ACTIVE]
`git stash pop` on a pre-existing stash is irreversible and destroys in-progress user work. To check whether failures are pre-existing, read existing output or use `git diff HEAD` — never touch git state. Any git operation that modifies history, stash, or working tree is a dangerous action requiring explicit user approval first.

### Load And Execute The Matching Workflow BEFORE Any Implementation [ACTIVE]
Completing prep steps does NOT authorize immediate coding. The workflow (e.g., `coding-flow`) must be loaded and each phase executed in order: discovery → specs → plan → HITL approval → implementation → review → validation → HITL → tests → final validation. Skipping HITL gates and reviewer phases leads to incomplete or misaligned deliverables that the user must catch.
- Spec approval is NOT implementation approval. After implementation, reviewer + validator subagents (per phase 6/7/11 of `coding-flow`) must still run before the post-impl HITL gate, regardless of request size or how clear the change looks.
- Even SMALL tasks under coding-flow require the reviewer phase (applies=ALL); skip only the phases marked applies=MEDIUM,LARGE.

### Keep Generators Generic And Content-Agnostic [ACTIVE]
When building template-based generators, separate the generic replacement engine from content production. Hardcoding domain logic inside the replacer blocks reuse and extensibility.

### For Byte-Parity Rewrites, The Generator Owns Only The Placeholder — Decode The Wrapper From Preserved Templates [ACTIVE]
When re-implementing a template-driven generator to byte-for-byte parity, the largest parity hazard (complex hook/JSON/shell payloads) is usually NOT all generated: the WRAPPER (matchers, advisory blocks, `version`, array brackets) lives in the preserved `.tmpl` files; the generator produces ONLY the placeholder string (e.g. `{{{bootstrap_hooks_<ide>}}}`). Read the preserved templates first to draw the line between template-literal and generated, then build a unit oracle that decodes the EXPECTED placeholder value out of the baseline output and asserts your assembly equals it — before driving the full `diff`. This collapses a "reproduce a 44KB file" problem into "reproduce one joined string."

### Verify Error/Limit MEASUREMENT Units Against The Baseline's Actual Messages, Not Assumptions [ACTIVE]
A size/limit/validation check can pass the FILE diff yet mis-measure: the new generator flagged 5 false "bootstrap entry > 10000 chars" violations because it measured the whole IDE wrapper (~18k, bash+powershell) instead of the per-entry `additionalContext` (~8.9k). The truth came from RUNNING the old generator and reading its exact stderr (`additionalContext is 11104 chars (max 10000)`) — which also revealed the old gen genuinely exits 1 on r3 (so exit-1 was correct parity, not a deviation). When a soft-error/limit exists, run the reference tool, capture its real messages and exit code, and match the measured UNIT to them; never infer the unit from the requirement prose alone.

### Independently Re-Run Exit Code + Dry-Run + Parity After Every "Done" Claim — Files-Green Hides Side-Effects [ACTIVE]
A subagent reported "dry-run writes nothing" with a passing test, but an independent run wrote 12 files: only `pluginWrite` was no-op'd while `pluginCleanup`/`pluginCopy` still hit disk, and the test's fixture had no preserved files so it never exercised the path. Orchestrator verification must independently execute the actual scenario (count files on disk under `--dry-run`, check the process EXIT CODE not just the file diff, confirm `--verbose` adds lines) rather than trust a green report. For dry-run specifically: assert ZERO filesystem mutations against a tree that HAS preserved files, since seeding/cleanup are the side-effects most likely to leak.

### Implement The User's Stated Mechanism — Do Not Substitute Your Own Abstraction [ACTIVE]
When the user names the exact mechanism/wording (e.g. "condition the templates by `release`"), implement that literally. Do NOT swap in a "cleaner" abstraction (e.g. a capability flag) justified by an internal rule — that is silent reinterpretation and confuses the user, who then can't follow the explanation. If you believe a different shape is better, propose it explicitly and get approval; never assume. Root cause of a real session derailment: substituted `advisory_hooks` for the requested release condition, then explained in terms the user never asked for. (User later chose a semantic flag themselves — the lesson is who decides, not which shape.)

### Don't Surface Internal Implementation Findings To Non-Code Stakeholders [ACTIVE]
Reviewer/agent findings about internal mechanics (loop crashes, escaping nuances, "what a template contains") are your problem to fix silently. Keep user-facing communication about THEIR decisions and observable behavior, not code internals — unless a finding changes a user decision.

### Handlebars/pybars3: Triple-Stache For Raw JSON, Comma Inside The Conditional [ACTIVE]
`pybars3` (Python Handlebars, cross-language twin of `handlebars.js`) double-stache `{{x}}` HTML-escapes (`"`→`&quot;`) and corrupts JSON; use triple-stache `{{{x}}}` for raw injection. `{{#if}}` takes a single truthy value (no `==`); for comparisons register an `eq` helper (`{{#if (eq a "b")}}`). When gating a JSON object member with `{{#if}}` on its own line, put the separating comma INSIDE the block as a leading comma on the conditional member, else the non-conditional branch emits a trailing comma → invalid JSON. `scripts/` is excluded from `mypy.ini` `files`, so untyped third-party imports there don't break type validation.

### Verify Target Runtime Capabilities Before Generating Code That References Them [ACTIVE]
Always confirm that assumed env vars, APIs, or runtime features actually exist in the target platform before generating code that depends on them.

### Cross-Process Mutex Requires An Atomic-Create Primitive, Not Rename Or Hardlink [ACTIVE]
When implementing concurrent-writer safety for shared files, plain `fs.renameSync` (POSIX rename overwrites the destination) and `fs.linkSync` (atomic per-name but doesn't serialize the read-mutate-write window) both fail under real multi-process load. Verified by spawning N≥10 concurrent processes: rename lost ~10% of writes; hardlink lost ~10% at N=30. Use an atomic-create primitive (`fs.mkdirSync` on a `.lock` directory, or `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` file marker) to wrap the entire cycle, with a stale-lock timeout (~30 s) so crashed holders don't deadlock followers. Always validate concurrency-sensitive code with real spawned processes, not in-process async or mocked filesystems — single-process tests cannot reproduce cross-process races.

### Validate Concurrency Claims With Real Multi-Process Tests Before Shipping [ACTIVE]
Unit tests that mock filesystem races (vi.spyOn, in-process Promise.all) cannot catch cross-process write conflicts on real filesystems. When a requirement promises concurrent-write safety, the validation MUST include a multi-process test that spawns N independent OS processes against a single shared resource and asserts (a) no lost writes, (b) no corrupted state, (c) no leaked lock artifacts. The cost is one bash/node script and ~5 seconds of CI time; it catches an entire class of bugs that pass every other gate. Build this test before claiming the feature is done.

### Adding A Command Input Field Means Updating Every Layer, Including The Base Type [ACTIVE]
A new command parameter is not "wired" until it exists at EVERY layer: (1) the base input interface type (e.g. `CommandInput`) — omitting this is a silent typecheck failure caught only at compile, (2) the command's `inputSchema`, (3) the run-delegate destructuring + required/validation check, (4) the CLI frontend (positional/option), (5) the MCP/named-field surface, (6) help content (usage/args/required/examples). After adding the field, run `typecheck` immediately — a missing base-type field surfaces there, not in tests. Treat these six layers as a checklist for any new command input.

### E2E Tests Spawn The Built dist Binary — Rebuild Before Running Them After Source Edits [ACTIVE]
rosettify's e2e suites (`tests/e2e/*.e2e.test.ts`) `spawnSync` the compiled `dist/bin/rosettify.js`, while unit tests import `src/` directly (vitest transforms TS). So `npm test` can show unit tests reflecting your latest source while e2e tests silently run against a STALE dist — a behavior change in src that an existing e2e doesn't exercise passes, but a new e2e that does exercise it fails with confusing results. After any src change that an e2e asserts, run `npm run build` before `npm test` (the e2e `beforeAll` only checks the binary exists, not that it is current). General rule: when a test harness shells out to a build artifact, rebuild the artifact as part of the validation loop, not just at publish time.

### Per-Vocabulary Processors And Per-IDE Assemblers Are Preferred Over Central Switch Dispatchers [ACTIVE]
When a behavior differs by IDE or vocabulary (model normalization, hook entry shape), the correct design is a case-specific processor per case — not one processor that switches on an identity-discriminant field. Identity encoded as an enum (`ModelVocabulary.kind`, `hookEntryShape`) and switched on at runtime is identity relabeled: it reintroduces the target-coupling the data-driven design was meant to remove. The pattern: export shared low-level helpers from one module; create one thin per-case processor file per case; compose the matching processor into each spec. Never add a `kind`/`shape`/`strategy` enum to a spec type when you can instead compose a different processor.

### Plan Contradictions Must Go Back To The Original Author, Not Be Fixed By The Orchestrator [ACTIVE]
When a reviewer finds contradictions in plan steps authored by an architect subagent, the correct response is to route the finding back to the architect (re-spawn or send message) for resolution — not to have the orchestrator interpret or reconcile the contradiction. The orchestrator lacks the architect's context and will produce a silent reinterpretation. Contradictory step instructions must be clarified at the source before implementation begins, or an explicit decision from the user must be captured in the plan.

### Requirement IDs And Internal Refs Belong In Code Comments Only, Never User-Facing Strings [ACTIVE]
Any `FR-`/`NFR-` identifier, internal path, or module name placed in a string that gets SERIALIZED or shown to a user — JSON-schema `description`, CLI argument help text, help-content fields, error messages — leaks internal traceability and violates the no-leak rule (FR-ARCH-0016); a serialized-help no-leak test enforces it. Keep all such identifiers in `//` or `/** */` comments. Before finishing any change that adds schema/arg/help/error strings, grep the diff for `\bN?FR-[A-Z]` inside quoted strings and move any hit into a comment.

## What Worked

### Inspecting Upstream `action.yml` With `gh api` Separates Repo Fixes From Upstream Limits [ACTIVE]
Querying the action metadata directly is a reliable way to prove whether a deprecation warning is fixable in-repo or still blocked by an upstream action publisher.

### Autouse Env Cleanup Fixtures Keep Tests Deterministic [ACTIVE]
Clearing auth-triggering env vars in test setup prevents flaky networked behavior and keeps unit tests scoped to local code paths.

## What Failed

### Top-Level Workflow Bumps Alone Do Not Guarantee Runtime Migration [ACTIVE]
Updating only the visible workflow file can leave hidden Node 20 actions in nested reusable workflows and create a false “migration complete” result.

### `mailto:` Values In `project.urls` Break Modern Packaging Validation [ACTIVE]
Using email links directly in package metadata can fail publish/install validation even when the project otherwise builds correctly.

## Hooks Runtime Abstraction — Baseline Notes (2026-04-29)

### adapter.ts Imports — Files Requiring Update When adapter.ts Is Split [ACTIVE]
Src: `loose-files.ts`, `md-file-advisory.ts`, `gitnexus-refresh.ts`. Tests: `adapter.*.test.ts` (×5), `loose-files.test.ts`, `md-file-advisory.test.ts`, `gitnexus-refresh.test.ts`. Entrypoints re-export via their own stubs and need no changes.

### hooks.json Is Generated From .tmpl By plugin_generator.py [ACTIVE]
`scripts/plugin_generator.py` reads `hooks.json.tmpl` and copies result to `.cursor/hooks.json`, `.codex/hooks.json`, etc. during pre-commit plugin-sync. Never edit generated hooks.json directly.

### Test Runner Is vitest [ACTIVE]
Canonical: `npx vitest run` (not `node --test`). All tests: `cd hooks && npm test`.

### Plugin Generator Source Is Release-Selected (Default r2) [ACTIVE]
`scripts/plugin_generator.py` is release-aware: `--release` selects `instructions/<release>/core` and defaults to **r2** (`DEFAULT_RELEASE`), matching ims-mcp's `DEFAULT_VERSION = "r2"`. r3 is opt-in via `--release r3`. To affect plugin output for a given release, edit that release's `instructions/<release>/core`; sync shared skills/workflows across `r2` and `r3` when they are meant to stay aligned.

### Hook Build Auto-Discovers All *.ts In hooks/src/hooks/ [ACTIVE]
`hooks/scripts/build-bundles.mjs` uses `readdirSync` — no explicit list. Adding a new `.ts` file is sufficient to include it in the build. The regression test (`hooks-registered.test.ts`) performs the same discovery and cross-checks `hooks.json` registration.

### Regression Test Requires All Discovered Hooks In ALL Plugin hooks.json [ACTIVE]
When scoping a hook to a single platform (e.g. claude-code only), add it to the `CLAUDE_CODE_ONLY_HOOKS` Set in `hooks-registered.test.ts` AND add a `isLibraryModule()` exclusion for any helper/data files (files ending in `-patterns`, `-evaluate`). Omitting either causes false regression failures.

### DANGEROUS_PATHS Patterns Are Basename-Matched — Caller Must Extract Basename [ACTIVE]
`DANGEROUS_PATHS` regexes (secret-env, ssh-private-key, netrc, etc.) are anchored with `^` and designed for basenames. The evaluation layer must extract basename from `file_path` before testing. Strip trailing slashes first: `filePath.replace(/\/+$/, '').split('/').pop()`. Full-path patterns (aws-credentials, kube-config) also exist in the same array — test against both full path and basename.

### ID Namespace Collisions Across Pattern Arrays [ACTIVE]
`DANGEROUS_BASH` and `DANGEROUS_CONTENT` may share conceptually similar patterns (both have DROP TABLE). Use namespaced IDs (`sql-drop-table` vs `content-sql-drop-table`) to avoid silent collisions when IDs are used in error messages or audit logs.

### Pre-commit Hook Runs Full Test Suite — Unrelated Failures Block Commits [ACTIVE]
`scripts/pre_commit.py` triggers `pnpm test` which includes the regression test. Any new hook source file instantly triggers a regression test failure for plugins that lack registration. Plan registration updates (hooks.json, CLAUDE_CODE_ONLY_HOOKS) in the same commit as the new hook source file, not a later commit.

## Discoveries

### Official GitHub Pages Setup And Deploy Actions Are Still Node 20 Upstream [ACTIVE]
As of 2026-03-18, `actions/configure-pages@v5` and `actions/deploy-pages@v4` still declare `runs.using: node20`, so those warnings are not removable by a repo-local version bump.
