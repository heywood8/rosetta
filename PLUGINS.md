# Plugins

Rosetta plugins bundle the bootstrap rule, skills, agents, workflows, and other instructions directly into your IDE. The agent loads them locally — no live connection to Rosetta is needed at request time.

Every plugin supports two installation methods:

- **Marketplace** — managed install from a plugin marketplace. Easier; preferred when available.
- **Standalone** — manual zip extraction into your repo. For agents without a marketplace path, or environments that block external marketplaces.

> [!CAUTION]
> You must receive prior approval from your manager and company to use Rosetta.

> [!WARNING]
> Use **Sonnet 5**, **GPT-5.4-medium**, **gemini-3.1-pro** or better models. Avoid Auto model selection.

> [!NOTE]
> This is pre-release, but it already works.
> There will be conflict if you have similar plugins installed: JUXT, Superpowers, GSD, AI-DevKit. Use the ones you have the most experience with.

## Step 1: Install Plugin

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code</b></summary>

### Claude Code

#### Marketplace

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add griddynamics/rosetta
claude plugin install rosetta@rosetta
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor</b></summary>

### Cursor

#### Marketplace

> [!NOTE]
> To add the plugin you need to have the appropriate Cursor plans, such as Teams and Enterprise. 

To Import the Rosetta github repository to your team/compnay internal marketplace:
* Use the following repository: https://github.com/griddynamics/rosetta

For detailed setup instructions, see the Cursor documentation:
* https://cursor.com/docs/plugins#team-marketplaces

**ALTERNATIVE**: Plugins installed in Claude Code are automatically available in Cursor.

> [!WARNING]
> Cursor automatically detects and uses Claude Code plugins. To avoid duplicate tools, commands, and context, do not install the same plugin separately in both Claude Code and Cursor.

#### Standalone

1. Download `core-cursor-standalone-*.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/griddynamics/rosetta/releases/latest).
2. Extract the archive contents into your repository.
3. Verify you can see a file `.cursor/agents/architect.md`. Ensure there are no `.cursor/.cursor` folders.

<summary><b>GitHub Copilot</b></summary>

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot runs in VS Code and JetBrains. Use **Marketplace** install in VS Code, or **Standalone** in either IDE.

#### Marketplace (VS Code)

1. In VS Code settings, add `https://github.com/griddynamics/rosetta` to `chat.plugins.marketplaces`.
2. Open the Copilot chat panel, click the settings gear icon to open agent customizations.
3. Click **Browse Marketplaces**, then **install** for `rosetta`.

#### Standalone (VS Code and JetBrains)

For JetBrains IDEs, use the standalone installation package.

> [!NOTE]
> The standalone installation is also detected by VS Code, so installing Rosetta through the standalone and marketplace methods will result in duplicate tools, commands, and context.

1. Download `core-copilot-standalone-*.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/griddynamics/rosetta/releases/latest).
2. Extract the archive contents into your repository. If `.github/copilot-instructions.md` already exists, merge contents — Rosetta first, then the original content.
3. Verify you can see a file `.github/agents/architect.agent.md`. Ensure there are no `.github/.github` folders.

<summary><b>Codex</b></summary>

### Codex

> [!NOTE]
> Codex plugins currently support hooks, MCPs, and skills only (as of April 2026).

#### Standalone

1. Download `core-codex-*.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/griddynamics/rosetta/releases/latest).
2. Extract the archive contents into your repository.
3. Enable hooks:

   ```sh
   codex features enable hooks
   ```

</details>

## Step 2: Verify

Ask the agent:

```
What can you do, Rosetta?
```

The agent will follow Rosetta prompts and show Rosetta workflows and execute `self-help-flow` (see screenshots from different tools below):

**Claude Code:**

## Upgrading

- Standalone upgrades require to redownload and replace files (install again).
- Marketplace plugins usually automatically upgrade.

See [INSTALLATION.md#upgrading](INSTALLATION.md#upgrading) for upgrade instructions for your installation method.

## Next Steps

Once the plugin is verified:

- **Run your first session and initialize the repo** — see [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md).
- **Explore the workflows** (coding, requirements authoring, modernization, and more) — see [USAGE_GUIDE.md — Workflows](USAGE_GUIDE.md#workflows).
